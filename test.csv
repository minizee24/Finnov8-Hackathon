166982,KloudStat,software,8/1/12,Analyze big data with R in the Cloud,"Analyze big data with R in the cloud (or iPad) #rstats #hadoop

Today, big data is the crucial in many applications areas from academic to businesses. Dealing with big data is not an easy issue. It is not only about the statistical software, we have the open source R, and the powerful hardware, we can easily have 1000 of instances with cloud providers; it is all about the ease-of-use, the cost and the experience. 

Commercial cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) promote its simple and fast access to general computing and hosting. But this is not true for most of the academicians and enterprises. You need at least an expert to spend some hours to setup the R statistical environment before your analysis. And it is just an instance. If you have computation intensive analysis, you will need a cluster of sereval instances with different layers of big data stacks. All the installation and configuration are becoming more and more complex. Were just data analysts. We just want to focus on data analysis. Why is it so hard? And end out nothing after some days of hardwork and resources wasted?

KloudStat, a cloud integrated development environment for open source R, provides the academicians and enterprises the platform to perform and focus on big data analytic processes that are critical in decision making without dealing with the backend production environment, such that KloudStat as a fast, scalable, distributed system can start with on a single server within a minute and expand to a cluster of instances optimized for each tier, i.e. R clusters, Hadoop clusters, databases and application servers of the system automatically. 

Besides giving the freedom of data intelligence to everyone at anywhere, anytime across multiple platforms, KloudStats collaboration feature allows a small group of collaborators can interact and do statistical analyses real-time with the virtual console, finally the source editing while all will be completely synchronize with local R software. 

KloudStats most interesting feature would be the modules or more advanced, big data applications development, which allows developers to implement the statistics engine in R with KloudStat APIs, while envolved in a top layer defined like a user interface. The main layer coordinates the lower layers where different engines based on several architectures are implemented. Each modules or applications created that contains many features are for specific task or purpose. These modules or apps allows faster data analysis and for everyone even dont have programming knowledge. 

KloudStat was built based on Rstudio server with pre-configured big data stacks, such as Hadoop. You can start analyzing your data as soon as you login to your console dashboard, no cluster configuration needed as all is automated and optimized. So far, the user had to start his R session with special MPI command. MPI binding is automatically created in the background and you can start your computer cluster using the packages snow, Rmpi or foreach without any additional steps.

The Seconds team holds the perspective that some of the best technology sits in the background of our lives - almost invisible - allowing us to complete tasks with minimal effort and distraction. Great technology solves problems we might not have realized we had. 

Ya know, making a transaction doesnt have to be such a nuisance; in fact it can be quite pleasant. We intend to bring that feeling to the greater world of digital payments.

The payment experience should be as quick, simple and intuitive as sending a text message.  The Seconds mobile payment system enables any device holder to send or accept payments, whether through the web, mobile web or a quick text message.  

Seconds is uniquely positioned in the mobile payments space by being:

PLATFORM AND DEVICE AGNOSTIC. Leveraging SMS and the web for payments allows Seconds to be platform agnostic, meaning any mobile device holder can transact with any merchant or brand connected to the platform.  

PROXIMITY AGNOSTIC.  Seconds dissociates proximity from transaction. Unlike NFC or dongle payments, consumers can pay for products or services from anywhere with Seconds. As a result, entirely new categories of mobile transaction--from rental payments to concert ticket purchases--are available anywhere, anytime for anyone.
 
CONNECTION AND COMMUNICATION ORIENTED.  Seconds sits at the convergence of communication and transaction. Not only does Seconds offer quick and easy payments, but it also provides the opportunity for brands to have a conversation and relationship with their customers via the SMS channel.

These initiatives have deployed a combined 2.6 million laptops to remote communities around the globe. There are plans to deploy 30 million in the next 5 years. But majority of these laptops are disconnected. 

OneBeep has developed an inexpensive and robust method to send educational content to these laptops. Using OneBeeps software a file of educational data can be converted to audio, which is sent via radio waves. This can be received on any cheap AM/FM radio, which passes it on to the laptop. The file is then converted back to its original form once it has been received on the children's laptops ready to be viewed. As every village has AM radios, you now have a low-cost way to beam out daily lessons, health material etc over long distances to thousands of children.

Cedar plc was fully quoted on the London Stock Exchange (CED.L). It had grown both organically and by acquisition. From its roots in the financial software market it acquired companies in the call centre software; data warehousing and data migration; document management and workflow; and content management arenas to deliver knowledge-based enterprise business solutions.

Cedar developed practical solutions around e-Business, customer relationship management (CRM) and knowledge management initiatives. Examples include content value management, eProcurement, enterprise portals and financial management.

These solutions were available through traditional installations, fully outsourced or delivered via the Internet using the Application Service Provision (ASP) model.

The customer base spanned the public sector (central government, local government and the National Health Service), telecommunications, major financial services organisations and significant commercial companies.

January 2002

2003

COA Solutions (then named Cedar Enterprise Solutions) purchases Goldenhill Ltd in order to offer human capital management (HCM) solutions to its clients.

The staff number now exceeds 450 and customers 3000. Version One retains its brand identity. The rest of the business is united under the CedarOpenAccounts brand.

2008

The Tipping Bucket site launches one specific ""Change the World"" project at a time, in one of seven impact sectorsâ Community, Health, Education, Energy, Environment, Justice and Opportunity. 

Each project has a specific funding goal and a deadline. Working alongside partners and collaborators, the site uses social media to guide micro-donors to each project to pledge as little as $1 (the default amount) to help that project get off the ground.

While there is no limit to what donors can give, the model is to raise significant financial and social capital for these ventures by spreading world-changing ideas and examples through ever-widening networks of individual donors who each contribute relatively small donations. 

Tipping Bucket's commitment to its donors is to ""change the world or your money back."" If the funding goal isn't met by the specific deadline, none of the transactions are processed and the next project gets its turn in the bucket.

48607,Project Insight,software,1/1/96,project management SaaS,"Project Insight is a mid-market, web-based project management solution that allows project 	teams to collaborate and share project 	schedules, assets and reports. Project Insight is delivered as SaaS (Software as a Service) but can be provided as on-premise software. 

Project Insight offers powerful, flexible features that satisfy experienced project managers and are easy enough for team members to learn and adopt.
In the past, experienced project managers had a couple of choices. They could invest in a high-end portfolio and project management software solution that takes a lot of time to implement, and even more time to train team members. Or, project managers could purchase a low-end project tool that serves the lowest common denominator. Often these tools lack the scheduling and resource management features that the program and project manager need. Project Insight bridges the gap with software that is robust, yet easy to use.

Some important features and benefits that Project Insight provides are:

-	Intelligent Project Scheduling - allows project managers to shift schedules with just a couple of mouse clicks.  The software leverages all task dependencies and types to automatically update the project schedule if the schedule changes.

-	Powerful Resource Management - project managers can effectively monitor and balance resource workloads across multiple projects from one report.  The report includes graphical displays that provide visibility over the entire organization. The project manager can view resource allocation on work scheduled across all projects and drill down to see projects and tasks.

-	Collaboration and Advanced Document Management - provides project teams with a centralized place for collaboration and document sharing.  Team members can upload and share project related files and documents in the document repository ensuring that the whole team is kept up to date.  This allows the team to maintain an entire project history with the help of version control and check-in/check-out capabilities.  

-	Workflow and Approvals - project approvals are electronically captured in Project Insight complete with comments and sign off.  Project managers can know exactly where an item is in the approval process, who has viewed it, approved or denied it, and why.  

-	Flexible Reporting and Executive Dashboards - Project Insight acknowledges that no two organizations are the same, so we've built in capabilities that allow team members to easily create custom reports, save them for future use and share with other team members. Project Insight allows team members to create over 100 different types of real-time management reports using project and portfolio data.

-	Time and Expense Tracking - all time can be entered to one timesheet.  Time spent on tasks, projects, customers and even non-project time can be accounted for.   We provide the capability to aggregate time and expenses across multiple projects per customer and create invoices.  Exporting to QuickBooks or Microsoft Excel is also an option.

-	Project Templates and Project MethodologiesÂ¬ - team members can create and reuse an unlimited number of project templates built from their own organizationâs current processes and best practices.  These templates help to standardize project processes across the organization, saving time on project creation.

-	Complete Project Budgeting and Costing â allows users to capture the planned budget and compare to actual in real-time to understand true project costs in order to save money.  At a glance, a project manager can know if a project is on time and within budget. Planned value and earned value calculations based on project work are also available.

-	Microsoft Outlook and Office Integration - optional client side add-ons provide an easy way to update projects in Project Insight.  Team members can upload emails, convert emails into tasks or issues and synchronize tasks from Project Insight to MS Outlook Tasks or Calendar.  They can also automatically add time entries and upload percentage complete from MS Outlook Tasks.  The option to edit and save MS Office documents directly into Project Insight is also available.

-	Options for Customization - Project Insight has been developed to allow teams to customize the software to fit their organization.  Project managers and team members can arrange the home/portal page as they please and administrators can add custom fields at the project, task or issue form without any programming.  Developers may extend the software further by using the SDK and Web Services APIs.

49912,Kidzmet,web,1/1/10,eHarmony for Students/Teachers,"High Concept: eHarmony for teachers & students

Kidzmet has two primary missions:
(1) To help kids discover who they're meant to become by
(2) connecting teachers, tutors & coaches with the local students they were meant to teach.
 
Similar to dating sites, Kidzmet is a connection engine that recommends local teachers & activities to parents based on teacher/student compatibilities in the realms of learning style, innate talents and personality type. 

We've all been there...your child begs to enroll in a certain extracurricular activity, only to decide two weeks into the session that she can't stand it. So, you're left to either (a) write off the money you spent on the series of classes or (b) drag your child kicking and screaming to the remaining lessons week after week as her initial interest in the subject dwindles.

But as 21st century parents, the burden is on US to provide well-rounded lives to our children--especially now that we need to fill the gaps in public school curricula that have been ""left behind"" by state budget cuts. 

But between juggling busy careers and hectic family schedules, it's tough to find the time to sift through hundreds of local enrichment activities and find the right fit for your family. 

Kidzmet profiles will include teacher bios, program and location information that even non-tech-savvy teachers can easily edit.

Revenues will be driven initially by teachers who pay an annual fee to be assessed and recommended to families with children that appear to be compatible with them.

We specialize in providing one source manufacturers of generic seizure medications to patients who suffer from Epilepsy. Retail and mail order pharmacies will often stock the lowest cost generic product in order to maximize their revenue. This is a concern because they may switch manufacturers products at any given time to take advantage of pricing opportunities. These manufacturers products effectiveness can vary from 80% to 125% above the branded drugs established bioequivalence. This means that taking one generic manufacturers product one month and switching to another the next month can result in a 50% or greater difference in a patients blood levels. Patients risk more side effects or insufficient efficacy and they run the risk of breakthrough seizures. This risk is too high to ignore for patients and their Doctors.

Nuropharma, Inc. guarantees the consistency of their generic seizure product from month to month. We will not change our manufacturer to take advantage of improving our profits to the detriment of patients with Epilepsy. On the occasion a manufacturer discontinues making a product we will notify you and your physician promptly. We will provide a new manufacturer product and compare their product, via dissolution studies, to the discontinued product to ensure that it has the smallest possible deviation from the patients past medication. We will also notify you and your Physician of any changes being made with your medications. This will minimize the risk of breakthrough seizures due to fluctuating blood levels.

Ki Work (the ""Company"") is a search and operational utility for outsourcing and finding online work. Online work entails any work that can be performed remotely over the web by individuals using IT and telecoms. Online workers are independent professionals (freelancers) that wish to access the global market for work from wherever they are  to live local and work global. The Company enables experts in specific categories of expertise to mediate the global sourcing and operation of online work between buyers and sellers of professional online services. These cover over 400 different categories across most business functions including accounting, administration, consulting, customer service, legal, marketing, recruitment, sales, software, training and web development.

Why Ki Work?

Enabled by high speed communications, social networking, and online collaboration tools, around ten percent of all work can now be carried out entirely online. As yet however, there is no effective means of both sourcing online workers, and then managing them in distributed teams within an operational and organisational infrastructure. Ki Work provides a solution to this by (i) facilitating the sourcing of online work to help businesses to find and contract with the best workers at the lowest cost; and (ii) enabling expert intermediaries to project manage teams of online workers.  

In an increasingly competitive global economy, companies require access to the best quality resources, at the lowest cost, and on demand. Ki Work uniquely addresses these needs through the creation of trusted online networks of buyers and professionals, facilitated by experts in specific categories of expertise. These experts act as ""power networkers,"" providing mentoring, pre-qualification and certification for professionals and buyers, building trust and co-ordinating projects involving multiple workers.  

Ki Work launched in beta in July 2008. See

""From the dawn of mankind the one idea we have all shared no matter race, religion or background that gives us our humanity is simply storytelling.""

So what is the Kaback Talent Academy?

At some moment, all of us at one moment, weather as kids or even as adults, we have wished or dreamt we were a famous singer, actor or even a model for a fleeting moment.

Designed equally for beginning talent as well as those with experience, the Kaback Talent Academy provides all potential talent with modern techniques, advice and most importantly the fundamentals to go from beginner to professional in the entertainment industry, by providing a foundation of training rooted in time-honored theatrical traditions of those who have been successful and now want to give back by offering the next generation advice and a roadmap of what works and does not work.

""The Academy is a FREE service offering instructional video clips on subjects such as, what experienced and new models, actors, musicians need to know to succeed. Examples are: How to be signed by a agent or manager to up to the minute access of real-time castings and auditions to downloadable e-books and PDF guides on insider techniques. You will learn how to land the Dream Job from advice that is written by real, successful NY and LA agents, managers, actors, directors, models, musicians and a whos who of A list individuals activity involved in the entertainment industry.""

Imagine a world without Arts and Entertainment.

Any endeavor in life takes experience and knowledge. For the past five years we have interviewed thousands of individuals who are truly amazing and gifted individuals but the one key factor many of them they lacked is either the education or perhaps the circle of friends and family to support their passion to have success as a model, actor or musician. We used to say to those individuals and families Why swim with ducks, when you can soar with eagles.

""Our concept is easy to master. Work hard, learn and perfect your ability and build relationships.""

At the same time we were saddened to see so many of these people spend hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars on products and services that promised success with all good intentions such as photos or classes that were a service but did not guarantee a shot at a legitimate job or even better a real opportunity to create a career. Thus you got just what you paid for pictures and basic classes. So we said what were these people lacking? What do the people and kids, perhaps anyone of any age, race or experience with talent; looks and determination really need to succeed or at the very least have that one shot to make their dream real and not some false promise with a price tag to boot?


Models, actors, musicians and vocalists that take advantage of Kaback Talent Academy are transformed with a social community that extends beyond the walls of the traditional classroom. Attendees are seen and heard by industry experts while learning. Kaback Talent Academy (KTA) offers the tools to connect and teach the keys of success from directors, modeling insiders and music superstars who know what is needed to succeed. Today, guidence to those with a dream or talent is non-existent. KTA has changed that with a simple fun format that is accessible to all.

From its early beginnings, Quidgest dedicated its resources towards
the Public Administration modernization, with large
research investments for this sector.
The high number of clients' requests and the lack of
technicians in the early 90's led Quidgest to create Genio, a
highly productive software development platform that has
been daily used since 1991 for the production of all
information systems.
Between 1989 and 1995, Quidgest centred its activity on
clients' specific requirements and developed an integrated
information system for Public Administration combining
Human Resources, Finance & Accounting, Assets
Management and Document Management, along with more
specific solutions.
Using Genio, the company's highly productive software
development platform, Quidgest developed a high capacity
of introducing new specification requirements in its
software solutions and quickly became a strong reference as
a custom-built software supplier.
Between 1996 and 1998, Quidgest migrated all its software
solutions to Microsoft Visual C++. In 2005, Quidgest added
C# and Java languages to its auto-generated code, being
able to produce multi-programming language solutions. All information systems produced by Quidgest from the year
2000 were available in MSDB Microsoft SQL Server and
were adapted a year later for Oracle and IBM DB2.
Quidgest became a Microsoft Certified Solution Provider in
1999, as well as a Microsoft Certified Partner in 2001;
Microsoft ISV/Software Solutions (Information Software
Vendor), Microsoft NIS (Networking Infrastructure
Solutions) and Microsoft Gold Certified Partner in 2005.
Also a certified training entity, with recognized Leader
SME, Quidgest joined COTECâs innovative SMEs network
in 2006. In early 2008, the company has also achieved the
ISO 9001:2008 Quality Certification, reinforcing its
national and international client portfolio with a guarantee
of excellence.
Quidgest is building a worldwide network of partners that
share Genio's automatic generation capabilities. QuidNet is
structured to deliver technology and services that provide
competitive and cost-effective business solutions.

1230,Revolution LLC,other,9/1/05,,"Launched by [Steve Case](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-case) in 2005, Revolution seeks to transform whole market sectors by shifting power to consumers. Revolution looks for companies that are attacking large, traditional industries with innovative new products and services. 

Revolution LLC has three core business groups: Revolution Ventures, Revolution Growth and Revolution Places.

Many industries are on the brink of disruptive change: At Revolution they build insurgent companies to capitalize on nascent opportunities. Revolution searches for businesses that recognize emerging market trends and pursues them, taking risks and ultimately defining their industry. Revolution scouts for innovative new products and breakthrough ways of doing things that are currently undiscovered, under-financed, or undoneleaving consumers under-served.

Revolution Ventures makes initial early-stage venture capital investments in companies, often in partnership with other top-tier investors, in amounts of less than $10 million.  Revolution typically leads early rounds of financing but will also follow other top-tier investors in companies they love with investment partners they trust and respect.  The firm is often involved as a Board member with a focus on strategy and developing a competitive position in the marketplace.

The Revolution Ventures team looks at business concepts that match its experience and interests.  These tend to be big disruptive ideas that attack areas of the consumer space ripe for reinvention, which have the potential to rapidly scale.  Businesses they engage with typically come from the consumer tech sector, media, entertainment, or other mass-market opportunities that offer a unique approach to tackling a staid category and grow into a significant consumer business.

The Revolution Growth team sees itself as business builders, not just investors. Its sweet spot is on technology-enabled businesses that empower consumers and disrupt existing, multi-billion dollar industries. Revolution Growth invests upwards of $20M in speed-ups  helping companies take ideas from niche to mass and scale to capitalize on huge market opportunities. The team is highly selective  typically investing significant amounts in only two or three new companies per year. They operate on a very hands-on basis and as a true partner, working relentlessly with management teams, over a long period of time, to help build their businesses.

Revolution Places invests in unique real estate and hospitality opportunities, creating a new model for travel and tourism that promotes and encourages a healthy lifestyle and establishes a consumer brand that reflects those values. The team invests in differentiated properties that have significant long-term development potential and in lifestyle hospitality companies with the opportunity to scale.  Revolution Places typical investment is in the $25-50 million range, and it is usually the majority shareholder.

Across all funds and business areas, Revolutions philosophy is that Consumers drive the changes in the marketplace; Revolution serves as the engine.",USA,DC,Washington,Washington DC,,,0,0,1/1/13,7/1/13,3

15555,Textbook Revolt,web,,,"Textbook Revolt aims to revolutionize the college textbook market by empowering students to save money by creating a trusted network for textbook exchanges.

The cost of college textbooks has doubled the rate of inflation over the past 20 years.  Students spend over $4.9 billion on college textbooks each year with few alternatives to help them save money.  The average yearly cost of textbooks has increased from $898 in 2005 to over $1,000 in 2006.  Every year television reports and newspaper columns have stories about the rising prices of textbooks and the lack of options available for the students, but there still has been very little progress in this industry.

Textbook Revolt began addressing the problem of high priced textbooks by experimenting with a completely free college textbook exchange named Socialbib.  The site has received many accolades from students who were previously dissatisfied with the options available to them.  As a result, students from over 1,300 schools nationwide joined Socialbib and posted over $1,000,000 in college textbooks.

Research proves that although online retailers such as Ebay and Amazon have added competition they have not significantly changed the landscape of the textbook industry.  Demand is rapidly increasing as the overall cost of education continues to rise.  It is evident that this problem will continue to exist as long as students are not presented with compelling alternatives.  The knowledge gained though Socialbib gives Textbook Revolt a competitive advantage to be the first service of its kind to market.  The demand from students when combined with the business opportunities create a ""perfect storm"" for Textbook Revolt.",USA,CA,Sunnyvale,SF Bay,,,0,0,,,0

To see more on WebActionHero please visit our features page.

Our theory surrounding action tracking is that by focusing on the details of task workflows and their associated risks, a more accurate picture will surface of your organization's risk profile at all levels; corporate, project and activity. WebActionHero can be described as Action Tracking for Risk Management, or we like to call it, Action Management.

Many companies still utilize ineffective and inefficient systems to manage risk issues and project changes, which is unacceptable given the consequences of poor execution and the recognized need for improved risk management.

Action Tracking supplements technical projects that require you or your collegues to collect and manage technical issues generated from HAZID, HAZOP, 3D model review, vendor FAT, interface, audit, completion punchlist and many more. WebActionHero does all that and more by allowing clients, vendors and other key interface groups to be included in your approval workflows, with all using the same centralized register.",CAN,,Halifax,Halifax,,,0,0,,,0

The Computer Division was led by Ed Catmull and the graphics project (soon called Pixar) was run by Alvy Ray Smith. Pixar was a hardware company developing highend image processing tools - in particular the Pixar 2D Frame Buffer. In 1984 they hired John Lasseter to help them produce their first animated film, primarily to demonstrate the power of their hardware. Over the years Lasseter created more animated shorts to demonstrate the Pixar, in 1986 creating Luxo Jr. Pixar was spun out of Lucasfilm and was purchased by [Steve Jobs](/person/steve-jobs) in 1986, at which point it became an independent company, although still a hardware company, and run by Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith. Failing to grow the hardware business, they became increasingly dependent on revenue from their animated projects, first doing commercials. Eventually they made a deal with Disney to produce the first full-length feature film entirely in CG. Jobs was not very focused on Pixar, and was trying to sell it in the early 90s. But on the strength of early viewings of Toy Story, he instead took Pixar public. The rest is history.

Pixar was acquired by [The Walt Disney Company](/company/the-walt-disney-company) in 2006, making Jobs the largest shareowner in Disney.",USA,CA,Emeryville,SF Bay,,,0,0,6/1/90,12/11/13,3

The first was in 2006 in London, where our Founder, Fan Bi, having always had a passion for menswear, experienced his first custom dress shirt. It was a transformative experience; the best he had ever felt in a dress shirt, but also painfully cost prohibitive. 

Three years later in Shanghai, he found himself again with a tailor, experiencing the luxury of custom, but this time at an accessible price point. 

Since then, Blank Label was founded and fused these two moments by acting on two principles: make men look, feel and be better, and pricing only for the quality on your back. 

We offer high quality and value by not having expensive stores, billboards, commissioned salespeople and middle-men. We are online and have a Fitting Room in Boston. 

We rely on our customers to tell their story and ours. And they do! 2013 is our forth year in business and with over 30,000 custom-made garments, our mission of creating quality and value in custom-made men's clothing is working. 

Stop compromising on fit and paying three times too much shopping off-the-rack. We are making custom the new standard for the discerning man.

16993,id Software,games_video,1/1/91,game developer,"id Software is responsible for some of the best-selling and most critically acclaimed video games of all time. Located in Mequite Texas, since their founding in 1991. 

Ushering in a new era of interactive entertainment with genre-defining blockbusters like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and QUAKE, id has secured itself a place in gaming history as one of the fathers of the modern video game. 

They were one of the first game shops to make the shareware distribution model work. 

It all began on May 5, 1991, when id Software, fresh off the heels of its success with the Commander Keen series of titles, gave the PC gaming world a glimpse of the future with the shareware release of Wolfenstein 3D. A shot of pure adrenaline, Wolfenstein 3D thrust gamers into a frenetic first-person universe of relentless action that would forever change the face of gaming. 

Widely recognized as the original first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D was later inducted into the Computer Gaming World ""Hall of Fame"" for shaping the overall direction of the video game industry. 

Then, on December 10, 1994, id unleashed DOOM on the world. A technically stunning opus of heart-stopping action, unspeakable horror and pure gaming bliss, DOOM heralded a paradigm shift in video games. Hardcore PC games were going mainstream. 

Selling millions of copies and chalking up tens of millions of downloads as shareware, DOOM remains one of the most popular PC games ever. And the title's impact on the gaming world is still felt today. 

With DOOM, id Software put the shareware distribution model on the map, with the game's runaway success owing a debt to the growth of Internet distribution. The company has continued to support shareware and other non-traditional means of distribution, influencing the way companies market and sell video games. 

DOOM also introduced multiplayer gaming to the masses, allowing players to compete in intense 4-player LAN or head-to-head modem competitions. 

id Software didn't stop there, the team of innovators also made DOOM's source code available to their fan base, encouraging would-be game designers to modify the game and create their own levels, or ""mods."" Fans were free to distribute their mods of the game, as long as the updates were offered free of charge to other enthusiasts. The mod community took off, giving the game seemingly eternal life on the Internet. In fact, id discovered many of their current employees and development partners based on mods that were created and distributed over the Internet. 

DOOM and its sequels went on to enjoy tremendous sales on virtually every gaming platform available - from the Sega Genesis to the Game Boy Advance. 

The next quantum leap in PC gaming came from id Software in 1996 with the release of QUAKE. Based on an all-new graphics engine, QUAKE was the first truly 3D video game, allowing players to interact with the virtual worlds created by id like never before. Gamers were free to look and move in any direction, giving the game designers at id the freedom and ability to create incredibly immersive environments in this epic, single-player game. 

id Software continued the tradition of QUAKE, with QUAKE II in 1997. Supporting multiplay for up to 32 players simultaneously, QUAKE II was a watershed hit for the company, selling more than one million copies, despite it's steep hardware requirements. By now, it had become clear that id's games were reason enough to upgrade, or even buy, personal home computers. 

In 1999, the easy-going guys from Mesquite further cemented their place in gaming lore with the ultimate deathmatch experience, QUAKE III Arena and the QUAKE III: Team Arena add-on pack. Designed to be the ultimate multiplayer experience, QUAKE III Arena has become the defacto standard for professional gamers and is the game of choice for tournaments around the world. A QUAKE III Arena tournament is the centerpiece of id's annual QuakeCon tournament and LAN party, played every summer near the company's headquarters in Mesquite. QuakeCon 2001 winners alone pulled in a combined $50,000 in cash and prizes. 

In 2001, id Software teamed up with Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software to develop Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a re-imagining of the original classic, Wolfenstein 3D. Built around the Quake III Arena graphics engine, Return to Castle Wolfenstein introduced a new generation of gamers to the epic series that started it all. In its first two months of release, Return to Castle Wolfenstein shipped over one million units worldwide, and has been widely acclaimed as one of the best computer games of 2001. 

The company also has enjoyed success licensing its revolutionary technology to other developers. To date, id's game engines have powered blockbuster titles from other producers, including Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune, Half-Life, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Star Trek: Elite Force, Heretic, Hexen and more. 

In August of 2004, id Software released the next chapter in the DOOM legacy, Featuring a new, mind-blowing gaming engine from John Carmack, bringing a terrifying new storyline based on the original masterpiece.

Founded in 2012, GET a GIG GmbH is looking for better ways to integrate the complex booking process into the lives of everyone involved. As a B2B platform gigmit.com enables musicians to showcase their work on individual microsites including everything business-related like technical rider, catering rider, social media visibility, external links, press material, audio and video file and much more. Promoters may do the same - adapted to their needs - and create open gigs for musicians to apply for. The trick is the matching algorithm of the platform which only offers musicians the gigs they actually fit. Therefore promoters get qualified applications tailored to their individual needs and may then choose from that range of applicants. If both parties agree on the basic rules for a gig - including fee, accommodation, equipment availability, on site personnel, and more - a deal sheet will be generated and offered for acceptance. If both parties accept the contract, contact details are shared and a customizable info sheet may be distributed to have all the details at hand in a downloadable format.

Agrisomaâs core technology is a proprietary method to introduce, express and manage new genes in plants.  Rather than randomly inserting the genes into a cropâs genome as is currently done, Agrisomaâs technology relies on engineering the crops genome to contain an âEngineered Trait Lociâ (ETL) that can accommodate an appropriate âdoseâ and âselectionâ of genes to reprogram the cropâs biosynthetic activity. The ETL technology is particularly suited to introducing the multiple genes required to achieve enhanced production of biofuels.  The ETL technology also has applications for gene stacking. 

The company began operations in 2002 and has focused on the application of its technology into biofuel development since 2004.  Agrisoma has achieved critical milestones in the application of its technology in major oilseeds and biomass crops for the production of renewable fuels.

193155,Visa Europe,ecommerce,1/1/04,Payments Technology,"Visa Europe is a payments technology business owned and operated by member banks and other payment service providers from 36 countries across Europe.  

Visa Europe works at the forefront of technology to create the services and infrastructure which enable millions of European consumers, businesses and governments to make electronic payments. Its members are responsible for issuing cards, signing up retailers and deciding cardholder and retailer fees.

Visa Europe operates a high volume, low cost business model that provides services to its members.  Its surplus is reinvested into the business and used to improve capital and reserves.

There are 466m Visa cards in Europe while 1 in every 6.75 spent in Europe is on a Visa card. Almost 80% of Visa Europe's business is on debit cards and, in the year to September 2012, over 1 trillion (1.02tr) was spent on Visa debit cards. Despite the challenging economic climate, total spend by Visa cardholders grew by 8.0% to 1.3 trillion. Annual online spending on Visa cards in Europe topped 200 billion (202bn) for the first time in this period and now accounts for more than 20% of Visa Europes processed business. 

Visa Europe employs 1,700 people on a permanent basis and we make a concerted effort to attract, inspire and develop capable, committed people from a wide variety of backgrounds to our business. We also invest in higher apprenticeships  equivalent to 2% of our workforce  because we believe they are the right way for our business to capture and develop entry level talent.

Since 2004, Visa Europe has been independent of Visa Inc. and incorporated in the UK, with an exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licence in Europe.  Both companies work in partnership to enable global Visa payments. As a dedicated European payment system Visa Europe is able to respond quickly to the specific market needs of European banks and their customers - cardholders and retailers - and to meet the European Commissions objective to create a true internal market for payments.

Importance of security

Ensuring payment security is one of Visas highest priorities. Over 1billion has been invested in technology and infrastructure over the past six years, building a robust and secure European payments platform from which to deliver the next generation of payment technologies. All Visa transactions are based on the international EMV chip standard which provides the most advanced and widely adopted cryptographic security for payments today. 

We continue to deliver unparalleled payments safety for consumers, merchants and retailers. Visa has a robust multi-layered approach to security which is proving highly successful in driving down fraud levels. Fraud losses on Visa cards are at an all-time low for the second year running (Europe-wide: 0.04%).

Benefits for all

Successful payment services bring tangible benefits to both consumers and retailers:

	Consumers (speed, control, convenience and security): consumers enjoy a quick, easy checkout experience, with no fumbling for notes or coins, and no need to wait for change. 

	Retailers (happier customers, increased sales, new efficiencies): retailers can see that their investments in new payments innovations will automatically enable them to benefit. With a quicker, slicker sales experience, customer satisfaction can be increased, queuing times reduced, and resources saved  and with fewer notes and coins, the costs and complexities of cash handling can be effectively addressed.

	Member financial institutions: consumers see the service as innovative, it meets clearly identified needs  giving members an opportunity to differentiate their brands, strengthen existing relationships and attract the attention of potential customers.

PhoneTell is free to its Users. 

Users need only type or speak the name of the contact they're trying to reach and PhoneTell's proprietary and patent-pending CallRank(tm) algorithms search not only scours native phone contacts, but the User's linked social accounts such as LinkedIn and Facebook and over 300M public and private business and personal listings...including thousands of ""secret"" customer service numbers assembled and hand-verified by PhoneTell to assure that human being answers the call and not an IVR system!  Search returns are User-experience informed; noting frequency, location, number of times successfully called by the User and his peers and are presented with one click to call simplicity.

In addition, PhoneTell's Call Assistant services ensure the User always knows who's calling via instant reverse Caller ID, even if the caller isn't in the User's contact file...and even alerts Users to inbound calls from telemarketers.  Users can elect to return these calls when busy in a meeting or in a movie with a one-click custom SMS message that automatically lets the caller know the the call has been received and acknowledged.  It's as simple as turning on the PhoneTell Do Not Disturb feature and just turning the phone upside down.  PhoneTell even puts a reminder to return the call on the User's calendar.  What could be more useful?

Finally, PhoneTell represents a major opportunity for marketers and businesses to place a highly targeted promotional message in the hands of a User who is looking for a product or service (via contextual search), physically close to the merchant (via geo-location) and ready to buy (during business hours).  This allows merchants to deliver a time-sensitive promotional message, perhaps redeemable in-store within a given time window, with zero waste, thus taking mobile lead-generation to its most useful and valuable level.

10736,uTag,web,9/5/08,,"uTag (http://ut.ag/) is a turnkey system that allows web 2.0 sites and individuals to generate revenue and retain attention from every single outbound link.

Rather than being punished for linking another site, by handing over the user's attention, tagging links with uTag captures that value in real money without any cost to the linker or linkee. uTag provides a true reflection of the value created by linking to another site.

uTag was created by a group of five Sydney entrepreneurs during, amazingly, a 48hr entrepreneur 'exercise' event call Startup Camp. The team was one of three working and coding tyrelessly with little sleep for the duration of the weekend event in a borrowed board room overlooking Sydney Harbour.

uTag has two implementation methods. For websites and platforms, site-wide implementation takes less than 2 minutes, costs nothing and requires no commitment. There is also an API for developers. The second implementation method is tag a single url for individuals to use in twitter posts, blog and forum comments and when the java script method is not an option.

The business proposition is as simple as implementation; there are no upfront costs and the link creator gets the majority of the revenue generated by the link. Additionally, once a url is tagged with uTag, all revenue generated by the link is attributed to the original tagger forever. There's no time or usage limit.

This could be a pivotal moment for the web, where for the first time the very nature of the web 2.0 world - linked content - is the basis of how people generate revenue",AUS,,Sydney,Sydney,,,0,0,1/1/10,1/1/10,1

24873,TVU Networks,ecommerce,10/1/05,live tv streaming video,"TVU Networks presents the only cross-platform P2P real-time streaming service that empowers broadcasters to reach an unlimited number of viewers across multiple platforms at a fixed low cost.  

TVUâs live broadcast platform allows broadcasters to connect to TVUâs global audience of 40+ million viewers on the PC, Mac, mobile, iPhone and STBs, and monetize through in-stream ad insertions.

Broadcasters on TVU include CNN, Turner Broadcasting, Cartoon Network, FamilyNet, Telemundo, Deutsche Welle, Globo, and TV9 India.  

At the core of the TVU platform is their patent-pending Real-time Packet Replication (RPR) technology.  RPR allows broadcasters to achieve massively higher reach and significantly lower broadcast costs over traditional streaming and CDN technologies.  RPR enables the delivery of a live TV signal, of up to HD quality, to millions of TV viewers around the globe using a single TVUBroadcast appliance and a single ADSL connection. With RPR, all the viewers watching a channel cooperate and contribute bandwidth to give everyone the best possible signal and viewing experience.  The bandwidth required to broadcast therefore does not increase with the number of viewers and higher viewership actually enhances the viewing quality. 

With TVU, broadcasters are offered a full suite of monetization tools, including subscription channels, pay-per-view events, and personalized in-stream ad insertion tools.  Content rights management tools and geo-filtering capabilities allow broadcasters to limit their coverage to specific regions, allowing them for example to honor existing cable distribution contracts while expanding their reach.  

The company's TVUAds personalized advertising engine enables seamless in-stream advertising that is targeted to viewers based on their demographics and geographies.  TVUAds enables the ingest of existing cue tones to empower broadcasters to effectively re-monetize their existing linear channels on the Internet, without needing to recondition the signal.

For almost 50 years, Moores Law has dictated the pace of technological change. As the number of transistors on a chip double approximately every 1.5 to 2 years, this increases the performance capabilities of computing devices and the many functions they make possible.  Unfortunately, with present silicon-based integrated circuits and manufacturing processes, performance and cost improvements under Moores Law are increasingly unsustainable, and will soon come to an end.

These physical limitations will increasingly impede electronics manufacturers from continuing to build smarter, faster, more efficient and cheaper devices  including sensors, lasers and computing devices (PCs, smartphones, tablets, etc).

By integrating optics and electronics onto one monolithic chip, POET will provide its customers with a rebirth for Moores Law and usher in a new wave of innovation in integrated circuits.

Dr. Geoff Taylor and the POET research and development team have spent more than 18 years developing and proving out numerous components of the POET platform, resulting in 32 patents to date, and six patents pending.",CAN,,Toronto,Toronto,11/28/11,11/28/11,1,5000000,,,0

(Storm) has developed a revenue engine for location-aware applications and services (LAA) e.g. Foursquare, Gowalla, OpenTable, and Yelp that provides customized discounts to consumers at the right time, in the right place.  

Storm provides LAAs with a solution through its White Label API to LAAs with two revenue-generating mechanisms: 
1)	Pull: LAA consumers choose special offers or certificates to particular restaurants or services
i.	Storm charges the restaurant or service a 20% commission 
2)	Push: a service, e.g. a restaurant, has a slow period and would like more customers immediately. The restaurant uses the Storm API to release a special offer to a subset of profiled LAA users in real-time
i.	Storm charges the restaurant or service a premium to the commission 

To enjoy these perks, people become members of Storm.  People can purchase a $15 a year membership with the first certificate or a âPayAsYouGoâ membership.  To see how the âPullâ product works, visit LetsGoForDinner.com. 

The restaurant market is a solid initial target, as restaurants, consumers and LAAs have a series of needs that each group can satisfy: 
a)	Restaurants 
        a.	Need customers on a cost-effective basis
        b.	Do not have the time or skills to undertake social media marketing effectively
b)	Consumers 
        a.	Want to save money but not be embarrassed by use/redemption
        b.	Desire discounts when and where they want them
c)	LAAs 
        a.	Have consumers but are searching for ways to monetize them easily
        b.	Users interact, play or check in primarily at restaurants. 

The North American restaurant market is worth $350 billion with one million restaurants, driven by an estimated $14 billion marketing spend. Storm has been able to prove that this is a profitable and growing market through its LetsGoForDinner.com consumer brand.  It generates $34.00 in annual revenue per member with an upfront cost of $9.00.  In a third of the cases this cost is self-funding from the $15.00 annual membership.  

LetsGoForDinner.com is piloting different rollout methods with bloggers and freelancers in order to drive down customer and restaurant acquisition costs. They will be combined with a new iPhone application and immediate digital acquisition solutions to increase revenue. With this model, Storm has a clearly competitive and different value proposition when compared to Restaurant.com, The Entertainment Book and other media (Yellow Pages, newspapers, TV and radio) that restaurants use. 

With minimal startup capital, the company has grown its consumer base and still has managed to introduce new products (preload, gift memberships/certificates and iPhone to be launched), acquire new restaurants (now at 30) and customers (4000 signed).

This is achieved due to a customizable user interface, top player-to-player ascetics, and complete coverage in synchronous and asynchronous games.

Developers benefit from Nextpeer's multiplayer functionality through significantly increased player engagement, cross promotion, and increased propensity for gamers to spend money in game. 

Nextpeer has stated the ability to integrate their SDK in ""as few as ten lines of code"". This may be the reason that since its launch in July 2011, Nextpeer has grown to a network of over a thousand Developers and over 1500 games and rising in the iOS AppStore (updated in May 2013).

Activities


Forex Trading

Eurivex is a pure STP broker offering margin and leveraged trading in forex trading through the Eurivex MT4 online trading platform.

Forex Managed Accounts

Eurivex offers Forex Managed Accounts to its clients. The Forex Managed Accounts are completely separate from retail forex trading, since these are handled by the portfolio management department.

Fund Manager(ICIS)

Eurivex can help in the proper structuring of International Collective Investment Scheme (ICIS) or Private Funds in Cyprus, through which a promoter can raise money from up to 100 investors legally under Central Bank of Cyprus permission without restriction and then invest in any project in the world, provided this is stated in the charter of the company and in the Offering Memorandum through which the promoter will solicit funds from investors. Eurivex, a regulated firm will act as overall fund manager, applying the investment decisions of the Board, making sure the company operates under MiFID rules and the KYC and AML rules are applied. Naturally, Eurivex will outsource the actual management of the project back to the on location managers, but it will show that âeffective managementâ is made from Cyprus. The supervisor and regulator of Cyprus ICIS is the Central Bank of Cyprus, a eurozone member central bank.

PLC listings on Cyprus Stock Exchange

Eurivex cooperates with lawyers for the formation of public companies, then list the company on the Emerging Companies Market of the Cyprus Stock Exchange (ECM/CSE), similar to what the AIM is for London SE. Companies listed on the ECM/CSE do not need to have min market cap, daily volume or max ownership. They continue to operate like a private company but secure all the advantages of a listed structure. Such a setup is ideal for beneficial owners to raise money or bring their own money under a regulated structure. Such companies will be free to acquire existing companies listed or private anywhere in the world and bring them under Cyprus umbrella through share issue or cash. Eurivex is a Nominated Advisor for ECM/CSE listings, which a company needs always to maintain. The supervisor and regulator of companies listed on ECM/CSE is the Cyprus Stock Exchange, a eurozone member stock exchange.

 
Trading Platforms

Eurivex uses the MetaTrader 4 trading system to facilitate clients to trade over single or multi terminals. Such platforms include the (MAM) Multi Account Manager platform for Introducing Brokers(IB) or Asset Managers.

The Challenge:

The place where a child is born should not determine the quality of his or her education and life prospects. However, the unfortunate reality is that a vast education inequity currently exists across our country. Just half of students in low-income communities graduate high school by age 18, and only 1 in 10 graduates from college. Closing this achievement gap will require cutting edge new approaches that address these challenges at a systemic level. There is a growing demand for solutions that use technology in creative ways to impact instruction and improve academic outcomes for historically underserved students.

The Opportunity:

The EdTech Entrepreneurs Lab is a program designed to seed innovative ideas among young professional leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs with a passion for education. This is an unprecedented opportunity for participants to design and launch truly innovative ventures that help close the achievement gap at asystemic level, with a particular emphasis on the power of technology to fuel solutions. Participants will have access to top resources in the education and technology fields  including workshops designed bythe Stanford Institute of Designs K12 Lab  as they develop game-changing, technology-based solutions that target educational inequity.

Applosophy was created out of a shared passion for mobile technology. Each member of Applosophy team came from a different field, each specializing in a different aspect of this technology, and brought with them to the table a unique talent that bloomed in like-minded company.

Applosophy believe that the right app can change our notions about the world- and everything in it! Not only can apps be used to make our lives easier, but they have the power to fundamentally change the way we see, interact with, and experience our world. Applosophy want to be at the forefront of that change.

The company invest in technology that touches almost every aspect of our lives. At its best, technology can be a powerful tool to enhance our experience and understanding of the world, make our lives easier, and bring us closer together. At its worst, technology can become an overwhelming and intrusive force that dominates, and sometimes controls, our lives.

But at the end of the day, no matter how sophisticated it becomes, technology is just a tool. How we choose to use that tool is up to us. Whether we choose to use it to broaden our horizons and increase our understanding of the universe, or watch videos of idiots hitting themselves in the groin, is up to us.

Children growing up in the information age have a heretofore unheard-of opportunity to shape their understanding of the world. No longer do children need to be the passive recipients of knowledge passed down to them by parents and teachers. They can now actively engage in the process of learning by choosing what, when, and how they will learn.

144159,MotionPoint,software,1/1/00,Website Translation & Globalization,"MotionPoint localizes any website for any market.  Its technologies and techniques deliver significantly more traffic and conversion than translation alone.

Initially when MotionPoint was founded in 2000, its focus was to help online retailers provide more complete, accurate and timely product information to shoppers.  One of the most popular features of MotionPoints virtual product brochures was consumers ability to view product information in different languages. 

MotionPoint soon learned that while retailers had a limited need for its virtual brochures, nearly every company with a diverse customer base was interested in making its website multi-lingual.

MotionPoint listened.  Website executives explained that the complexity and expense of building and maintaining a multi-lingual web presence caused them to severely limit their multi-lingual content  or to offer none at all. 

MotionPoint found a better way.  The company developed a suite of patent-protected technologies that make it quick and easy to add any language to any website  without any client IT development.  This approach continues to be a game-changer, eliminating the cost and complexity traditionally required by website translation. 

MotionPoints first multi-lingual website client debuted in Spanish on November 1, 2003.  Fifteen more sites followed in 2004.  By 2007, MotionPoint was launching more than 100 websites every year.   Today, MotionPoint provides website translation and globalization services for hundreds of clients, serving billions of multi-lingual web pages each year.

In 2009, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted MotionPoint four patents for its unique technologies used to dynamically translate and automatically synchronize websites.  additional patents are also pending.  

For nearly a decade, MotionPoint has received praise and recognition from leading industry analysts.  MotionPoint has been highlighted as a Cool Vendor by Gartner, Inc., and featured in several Forrester Research reports on multi-lingual website development.   MotionPoint has also been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Internet Retailer, Hispanic Market Weekly, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, The Miami Herald, Government Technology and others.

5767,Dotmenu,web,9/1/97,Online ordering,"Dotmenu was born over a decade ago when company founder Michael Saunders was a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. While studying for finals, Saunders decided to order himself a tuna hoagie. After encountering two busy signals and one accidental disconnection, his delivery order was placed. When the hoagie finally arrived, Michael was saddened by the discovery of condiments he most certainly had not requested. 

A lesser man might have just swallowed his frustration, but Michael Saunders decided to act, if only to keep future generations of tuna hoagie craving college kids from suffering the same fate. Michael set himself to the task of building an online restaurant network that would make busy signals, disconnections, and grievously misheard toppings requests a thing of the distant past. After many years, Michael's dream became a reality.

For over a decade now, Dotmenu has been making it easier to stuff food into people's faces. Thanks to the massive growth of our flagship websites Allmenus and Campusfood, Dotmenu has expanded its waistline to become the largest online food delivery network in the world with over 1.7 million registered users, nearly half of whom are college graduates.

Having started out on just 18 campuses in 2000, Campusfood is now the number one late-night pizza and wings solution on 400 college campuses. Allmenus boasts over 250,000 menus, connecting famished Americans with their favorite restaurants in nearly every major city. Our sites have been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Businessweek, and too many other publications to name.  

Headquartered in the Flatiron District of New York City, Dotmenu is a privately owned company composed of talented, innovative, and yes, hungry individuals.

Compared to other existing solutions, The Business Plan Shop is based on a 'real' financial model rather than a template. 

In traditional business plan software the user has to input high level elements. For example the direct cost of sales of a product. However this number is usually composed of different elements (for example the cost of goods, the cost of delivery and the card processing fee for an e-commerce site) which have different drives (some vary with the volume sold, others with the level of sales, etc.). 
As a result the user needs to compute these high level elements on a separate spreadsheet which quickly becomes a nightmare when he wishes to change one of the assumptions. 

With The Business Plan Shop's tool, the user has the option to link several costs which have their own drivers (volume sold, revenues, cost of sales, etc.) to one product. As a result it makes it very easy to change one assumption and get a new cash flow forecast.

specific gameplay achievements, such as regularly being the first person in

often. Post-launch, OneTrue fan will launch a dashboard, enabling web sites 
get a multi-dimensional view of their readers based upon frequency of visits,

Pelago's mission is to remove all barriers to inspiration, information and human connection.

Pelago's most recent product, Whrrl v2.0, enables storytelling in our daily lives. Launched in March, 2009, it is a mobile and Web application that enables people to capture and share the moments of their lives, as they happen, in story form. Through location, photos and text updates, users can easily turn everyday life experiences into lasting stories that can be remembered, organized and shared. The user controls exactly who can see his or her story, ranging from total privacy to publicly visible, including optional broadcast via status updates on Facebook and Twitter.

Whrrl v2.0 is available now as a free application through the iPhone App Store, and anyone can participate via the Web, SMS text, and digital cameras with an Eye-Fi wifi-enabled memory card.

Whrrl v2.0 stories are collaborative: two or more people who are physically together can âjoinâ and contribute to the same story from their separate phones, allowing a single shared experience to be expressed from multiple points of view. In addition, each story has its own unique URL that can be easily shared. After the real-world experience ends, the story may be edited by the participants via the Whrrl website and shared with others through Facebook, Twitter and/or email.

Whrrl v2.0 on the iPhone utilizes Facebook Connect for Mobile to allow Facebook users to bypass Whrrl v2.0 account creation and login with their Facebook accounts. Linking a Facebook account to Whrrl v2.0 also enables access to the userâs Facebook friends list, ability to publish stories as status updates, and all photos taken through Whrrl can be automatically published to Facebook photos.

For non-iPhone users, Pelago provides several ways to participate in Whrrl v2.0. First, any mobile phone user can create and update stories by sending SMS text and email messages. Second, people who own a digital camera and an Eye-Fi wireless wifi-enabled memory card can upload pictures taken with the camera in real-time to a Whrrl v2.0 story. Finally, anyone can visit the Whrrl v2.0 website (www.whrrl.com) to view and comment on stories. ",USA,WA,Seattle,Seattle,11/1/06,5/27/08,3,22400000,6/30/08,4/18/11,3

The Accelerated program is the course offered by Mobile Makers. This is created for developers, who want to better themselves technically, and interested in making the move into mobile. This course is held in the evening for three hours per night, two nights a week. Like the Immersive program, the Accelerated program covers all areas of iOS and provides mentors, coaches, and an instructor, but moves at a much more rapid rate, covering everything in four weeks.

Launched in June 2011 as the joint initiative of Internet Holding A.S and Ottoman Ventures, LilaKutu generates original video content, Q&As, expert views and articles on beauty tips and tricks, how-tos as well as interview videos with the major cosmetics brands.

While generating vast content in-house, LilaKutu records visitors' beauty needs and preferences in an interactive beauty profile and tracks/logs all visits based on the pages they visit, the amount of time they view each page, the links they click on, the searches they make, the products they review and the content they consume. All these actions combined automatically generate a 'virtual profile' which is used to position related products in front of those visitors who exhibit a greater level of interest and intent to purchase.

Based on its technique for increasing the relevance of product offers and promotions on a visitor by visitor basis and succesfully blending content with commerce, LilaKutu visitors discover beauty products as they consume content on the site.

Through its monthly subscription service, the company sends curated beauty boxes to members who customize a profile based on their own needs (skin type & coloring, hair type, eye color, lifestyle, whether they like trendy stuff or classic items, what kind of style they have, etc.) Each month customers can earn points for purchasing products, by subscribing to the monthly service, writing reviews or by simply inviting friends. Reward points can be redeemed off as coupons and discounts to use on full size products.

Redbeacon goes beyond returning business listings with ratings and reviews by helping consumers determine the right service provider for their specific needs and allowing them to compare price quotes and book appointments online.  

Consumers describe what they need done and specify when and where their job should take place.  Using patent-pending machine learning and semantic technology, Redbeacon determines the best local service providers for the job.  If matched, service providers get notified by email and text message and are given the opportunity to submit a price quote.  Consumers can then select and book appointments with their top choice service provider based on a comparison of business profiles, price quotes, and ratings and reviews from past Redbeacon consumers. 

Redbeacon is also the only website where consumers can go for urgent or immediate requests (e.g., ""I need someone to come change my tire immediately"") and get back an Estimated Time of Arrival from interested service providers in their area.

For service providers, Redbeacon may represent a better value proposition than other online marketing options because it is free to create skill profiles and receive job leads.  Service Providers only pay a small commission when they win a job, which minimizes the risk of wasted marketing dollars.  Redbeacon is also useful for service providers who wish to offer long-tail services or services at irregular times, such as nights and weekends.

43504,Twiddish,mobile,1/1/10,Dish Focused-iPhone App & Social Net,"Twiddish, innovated by StewartSoft,  is a new social network and geo-location mobile application for iPhone and iPod Touch that allows diners nationwide to discover the best and worst restaurant dishes through user-generated photograph-based dish reviews. 

The twiddish application compliments the online twiddish social network by providing users, aka dishers, with the real-time micro-blogging tools needed to share their dining experiences with fellow diners on a visual dish-by-dish basis.

Each twiddish review contains a photograph of the dish, as taken by the disher as the food is served, along with a twiddish rating based on flavor, aroma, portion size, presentation, and value.  Dishers are encouraged to share any additional comments that might be helpful to fellow dishers in selecting a particular dish or restaurant by entering them into the optional comments field.

âtwiddish is a paradigm shift from traditional reviews that focus on details such as dÃ©cor and ambiance while providing less information on what actually draws diners, the food.  twiddish cuts through this clutter and guides diners to make more informed dining decisions, whether dining out or ordering in for delivery, by providing them photographs and commentary that represent exactly what they can expect when ordering a dish at a given restaurant, â says twiddish co-founder Jonny Cottone.

Dishers can search the twiddish social network by dish name, via either the mobile application or website, to discover those restaurants that have been recognized by fellow diners for either their exceptional or inferior preparation of the dish.  Dishers can also search twiddish by restaurant name to discover itsâ signature dishes according to twiddish community members that have actually eaten at the restaurant.  âWhether in town or on the road, twiddish is a gastronomic guide that helps diners locate the very best of the dishes they crave nationwide,â says twiddish co-founder Michael Stewart.

Dishers can sync their twiddish profile to other popular social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, to tell their friends what they are eating and whether they recommend their peers to do the same.  

The twiddish application is now available for free download from iTunes app store at www.twd.sh for iPhone and iPod Touch users.  Diners without a compatible mobile device can create a twiddish user profile and interact with the twiddish dining community via the twiddish website at www.twiddish.com.  The twiddish application and website were both developed by Fuzz Productions.  twiddish anticipates launching itsâ blackberry application in the Spring of 2010.

725,imeem,music,11/1/03,Social music service,"imeem is an online music service that gives fans instant access to almost any song they want, for free. 

The company, founded in 2003 by [Dalton Caldwell](/person/dalton-caldwell), takes its name from ""meme"" - a term coined to describe the ideas that communities, adopt, and express.

imeem started as an instant messaging service that let people communicate through chat, blogging, instant messaging and sharing files. This model didn't pan out, and in 2006,  the company reinvented itself as a social networking site that let people discover, play and share music, music videos, and photos. 

In September 2006, imeem introduced embeddable flash playlists that gave people the ability to take music and video playlists they created (or found) on the site and embed them virtually anywhere on the web. imeemâs players quickly became popular with consumers using [MySpace](/company/myspace) and other social networks, giving them a way to customize & personalize their profiles with music. 

imeem pioneered the ad-supported streaming music model. In 2007, the company became the first-ever online music site to secure licenses from all 4 major music labels (and thousands of indie labels and artists) to offer their music catalogues for free streaming and sharing on the web.

Under this model, artists and labels are paid a share of the imeemâs ad revenue in proportion to the popularity of their music on imeem, and have the right to register their content and determine how (or whether) that content is available on the site or through its embeddable widgets.

This business model is made possible by imeem's proprietary content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. Initially, imeem licensed this technology from [SNOCAP](/company/snocap), the digital rights and content management startup founded by [Napster](/company/napster) creator [Shawn Fanning](/person/shawn-fanning). In 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP and its technology outright; as part of this acquisition, SNOCAP's COO, [Ali Aydar](/person/ali-aydar), joined imeem's executive team.

In December 2009, imeem was acquired by MySpace for $1 million.",USA,CA,San Francisco,SF Bay,9/1/04,8/1/09,5,24750000,10/22/08,11/10/10,3

323,Qualcomm,semiconductor,1/1/85,Telecommunications Company,"In July 1985, seven industry veterans came together in the den of Dr. Irwin Jacobs San Diego home to discuss an idea. Those visionariesFranklin Antonio, Adelia Coffman, Andrew Cohen, Klein Gilhousen, Irwin Jacobs, Andrew Viterbi and Harvey Whitedecided they wanted to build Quality Communications and outlined a plan that has evolved into one of the telecommunications industrys greatest start-up success stories: Qualcomm Incorporated.

Qualcomm started out providing contract research and development services, with limited product manufacturing, for the wireless telecommunications market. One of the teams first goals was to develop a commercial product. This effort resulted in OmniTRACS®. Since its introduction in 1988, OmniTRACS has grown into the largest satellite-based commercial mobile system for the transportation industry today.

This early success led the company to take a daring departure from conventional wireless wisdom. In 1989, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) endorsed a digital technology called Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). Just three months later, Qualcomm introduced Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a superior technology for wireless and data products that changed the global face of wireless communications forever.

Today, Qualcomm plays a central role in the rapid adoption and growth of 3G and next-generation wireless around the world. Qualcomm has an extensive portfolio of United States and foreign patents, and we continue to pursue patent applications around the world. Our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed portfolio in the industry with over 195 licensees.",USA,CA,San Diego,San Diego,,,0,0,1/1/13,12/9/13,3

24108,WiTricity,cleantech,1/1/07, wireless electricity,"WiTricity Corp. was founded in 2007 to commercialize an exciting new technology for wireless electricity invented two years earlier at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

A team of physicists, led by Professor Marin SoljaÄiÄ, developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. 

Prof. SoljaÄiÄ's team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This âstrong couplingâ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  

 Prof. SoljaÄiÄ was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship (also known as âGenius Grantâ) in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the âTop Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008â by Technology Review, âTop 100 Science Stories of 2007â by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: âThe Year in Ideas â 2007.â",USA,MA,Watertown,Boston,5/19/08,10/23/13,2,29000000,8/1/08,9/29/10,2

1498,Motionbox,games_video,1/1/06,Video Sharing,"Motionbox is a video sharing service with a lot of other cool and impressive features. Motionbox doesn't have a client uploader like Crackle (formerly Grouper) and VideoEgg. Users must upload the full video files to the service. Like YouTube, Motionbox transcodes files to flash to reduce file size and standardize viewing. But they also store the original files and allow users (and those authorized) to download those files and/or purchase DVDs with the files. 

Video editing is a pleasure on Motionbox. When editing a video, Motionbox breaks it down visually into frames. Users can edit the file extensively, including linking several video files and removing any portions of files. Mashups with other users' public or shared videos can also be created using Motionbox's extensive editing features. 

All of these changes can be pushed back to the original quality files for downloading or DVD burning. Like YouTube and other services, Motionbox allows tagging of video files. But they also allow deep tagging of parts of video files. Users can open a file, select a portion of the video, and tag it. Viewers are able to skip right to that clip of the video by clicking on the tag. Longer videos can now easily be broken down into linkable pieces. 

Motionbox began supporting high definition video in March 2008.

By clicking on their ""sphere""of influence, they will be able to see every other Zolve member on a Google Map who is connected to them by two degrees of separation. The whole point of the site is to generate referrals between real-estate professionals. A broker can get 25 to 30 percent of a commission if she refers a customer to another broker. This is done all the time within the industry, especially if a potential home buyer is looking outside the first broker's immediate geographical area of expertise. For example, a broker in San Mateo might sends business to another broker in Denver,and collect a referral fee of a few thousand dollars if the customer ends up buying a property there.

Brokers will be able to establish their real-estate cred by blogging on their profile pages. Each transaction also generates a reputation score similar to eBay's. (Not only can the brokers vote on each other's reputations, but so can the home buyers or other customers involved). By automating such referrals, founder Brian Wilson thinks that he can create a system where real estate professionals can tap into each others' detailed knowledge of their own markets to counter the Zillows of the world.

Noitavonne is the answer to increasing demand. The public and private sectors want:

(1) Access to mobile connectivity with ease and fewer barriers less the cost of infrastructure enhancements
(2) Secured access to and storage of data on mobile platforms
(3) Access at a cost that is manageable, in such a way that they are neither socially nor economically excluded from consumption

The companys experience in business process analysis, data analysis, system design and development provides it an edge in developing innovative and useful products.
The Spirit of Noitavonne is best expressed through its very name which is e-nnovation spelled backwards. It is the technology house where innovations merge with possibilities and transform into an experience. The companys patent pending LOOP Connectivity Protocol has become just one shining example of the high level of technological innovation that is produced at Noitavonne. Another is The Loop Tablet, which has many capabilities including cellular, computing, video, e-Reader, music and controlling wireless IR remote applications. The device acts as a phone or it can be a smart phone companion where the cell phone wirelessly displays in the Loop Tablet User Interface allowing the user to perform all the cellular phone functions in addition to the full spectrum of tablet functions. The visionary behind this product, Lael A. Alexander, has a knack for building upon ideas to continually improve on what others might deem perfection. However, it is his experience in technology that spans decades and crosses multiple functional industry sectors ranging from healthcare to energy related segments that continue to prove up his concepts from a practitioners approach.

Currently, the company is focused on the launch of its developed line of products including the Noitavonne A357 series of Android smartphones; The Noitavonne Loop tablet which comes in two sizes (7 & 10) and the companys premier tablet, The Noit Embrace which won Best In Show at the CTIA Wireless Technology conference. All products are set to debut 2012-2013. In an ever changing environment, the last forty years has led to a rapid pace of technological advancement leaving consumers to shed personal computers for tablets, landline phones to smartphones and physical storage units to the cloud. However, the breakthroughs that Noitavonne has innovated will advance technology with lightening force into the realization of connectivity beyond the space age. Noitavonne finds itself on the cusp of one of those great moments, the birth of a new breed of technology, the Microsoft and Facebook moment when the intangible becomes tangible and the impossible becomes reality.",,,,unknown,,,0,0,,,0

Dynamo's ""viral demand loop"" bridges the promise of Cleantech hardware

Dynamo cultivates the user relationship beginning with a home energy audit. Then dialogs with the user base on a personal level about relevant solutions 
and incentives as available.


The average Joe doesnât know and canât be bothered to care about energy efficiency. This makes it near impossible to create demand for efficiency hardware and services even with significant proven savings. Dynamo advocates that people will become interested once they are shown how their actions are tied to their pocketbook. Utilities currently bare the brunt; forced to meet demand, supply costs skyrocket. Peak load creates grid stability issues, and utilities are forced to threaten their customers with rolling blackouts.

5,Facebook,social,2/1/04,Social network,"Facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/).

Facebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. 

The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.

With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. 

With millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. 
 
In the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the ""kid"" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. 

Not long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.

Facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).

One sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). 

Notwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.

Facebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _The Social Network_ was released which chronicled Facebook's inception.

In its 2012 [IPO filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.",USA,CA,Menlo Park,SF Bay,9/1/04,1/21/11,11,2425700000,1/10/09,12/12/13,5

Dynamic Pricing
This is the most innovative way to buy online where everyone wins! The unique Spinzo platform allows merchants to dynamically price their offerings based on the number of people interested in buying. Every time someone joins a Spinzo deal, the price drops for everyone... yes everyone! Gone are the days where you paid too much money for a product, only to see it go on sale the next day. With Spinzo, pricing is fair for both merchants and consumers. Our promotions are also viral.

Did you say ""Viral""?
Yes we did, and we mean it. With Dynamic Pricing, consumers are compelled to share with friends, because the more people that join a deal, the bigger the savings for everyone! This is truly a social buying experience where more is better.

Unique Offers
Some websites showcase typical products and services with nothing exciting or original. At Spinzo, we're focused on delivering unique and exclusive offers. How do we do it? Our Dynamic Proving model gives merchants the ability to provide something unique that wouldn't have otherwise been possible with traditional pricing methods. Think exclusive meals, events, or adventures.

A True Partnership with our Merchants
At Spinzo, we're innovating on pricing and promotion, but we'll never sacrifice the importance of a face to face relationship with our merchants. We work with local merchants on an individual basis to craft the best promotional experience possible. For each of our merchant partners, Spinzo builds a ""community of buyers"" which serves as a merchant's most loyal group of ambassadors. The ""community of buyers"" can receive exclusive offers, promoting a sense of loyalty not found in traditional social media.

Join us!
We're eager to work with consumers, merchants, and partners as we lead the shift toward a more innovative world of commerce. We've got a great platform, more innovation in the pipeline, and great ideas for the future. Contact us anytime to learn more, get involved, or become a partner.

--
We all have twitter today ... But when you have a twitter account with more than 200 followers you miss all the best tweets they do, or you must take the time and read everything.

We had this problem and started jealo.us. We hope finally everyone post their new bought shoes, dresses, cars, vacation trips, moments, etc. @jealous. If you login, you can see everything your twitter friends posted @jealous, so you can decide you are indeed ""jealous"" or you think the post is ""boring"". You can also leave a comment.

We just launched the website and we're still working on it. If users use the # we save the location. If you select ""spots & brands"" in the menu (not yet implemented) users can see the most popular locations or brands. Also we show the user how much they spent there and at what location (if there is a value in the post, like $59).

We are still busy with the spots & brands. This is a large item. Here we try to get the user a lot of information. Example tweet, ""I finally have my new IPhone 4 $99,- #macstore @jealous"" we know it's bought in a macstore and if there is a GPS location we know which macstore it is and that the price at this macstore is 99 dollars. (if the price is entered in euros the system automatically recalculates the value to dollars). In the spots & brands we show this post with the apple logo, a short description of the brand apple, all other post from user who used #macstore (or similar, like apple) and a total spent of all jealous users. Here you get a clear view of all users who bought an apple product, where and what they paid.",NLD,,Urk,Urk,,,0,0,,,0

85924,Visier,analytics,3/1/10,SaaS Analytic Applications,"At Visier we build analytic applications for human resources. Complete, end-to-end solutions are hosted on-demand and deployed in days.
Unlike traditional business intelligence which aims to provide powerful tools for users to create content, the Visier approach is to focus on the content itself. This removes the burden of the end-user from trying to figure out first how to use the tools provided, and second what questions should they try to answer with the tools. The Visier solution seeks to remove both of these challenges. 
The Visier solution further tries to separate itself from traditional enterprise approaches to analytics by significantly reducing both time and cost for deployment and ongoing maintenance. Part of this is achieved through the focus on a full analytic solution, or application, and part through a SaaS delivery model. Among other methods used to shorten times and reduce costs, Visier has put significant investment in user experience and design.
Visier Workforce Analytics represents Visier's first analytic application. Significant investment has been made to provide an intuitive, interactive and overall visually appealing environment. The design philosophy is that analytics are best consumed by seeing the insights, and so visual representations are extremely important. Further, analytics and the decisions that come from them, are most impactful when broadly supported. Being able to easily share a compelling insight is one of the best ways to influence and get support for decisions.

No single search engine covers the entire Internet. Different engines use different technologies and thus draw different results from the vast pool of available information. The metasearch-driven searches cover more of the Internet because they combine the most relevant returns from multiple search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Ask, and Bing.

InfoSpace's metasearch technology provides users with the ""best of the best"" results each time they search. InfoSpace metasearch helps advertisers achieve a much higher match rate than any other search engine and delivers more sponsored listings per commercial search. Sites hosting metasearch receive a higher pay-per-click rate, which is a key selling point when InfoSpace engages with potential private-label search customers.

To serve this growing need, Simplex secured $50 million in venture capital from New Enterprise Associates and acquired Diabetes Care Club in September 2007. Prior to the acquisition, DCC employed 35 associates and had a patient base of 20,000 patients with diabetes.

Since then, Diabetes Care Club (DCC), a Simplex brand, has grown to become the third largest mail order supplier of diabetic testing supplies for seniors.  The Companyâs growth has been rapid, as it now employs over 300 associates and serves over 180,000 patients.  Additionally, DCC has expanded their line of complementary products that address the complications of diabetes.

Simplex Diabetic Supply recently changed its name to Simplex Healthcare.  The change in name will enable the holding company to diversify its product lines while maintaining its superior patient care.  As we continue to grow the number of patients we serve, we will continue to add complimentary products and services to help our patients simplify their medical needs and live a more active lifestyle.

The Cerrio platform is a visual platform running in the cloud that makes building and maintaining real-time software extremely easy and very affordable.  Cerrio abstracts away the difficult problems faced by real-time software developers.  It flattens the learning curve and lets developers focus on business logic.  Cerrio developers do not think about their physical infrastructure, choose a technology stack or identify and manage hosting services.  Cerrio developers do not have to build a messaging service, stream operators or adapters to connect to third-party data sources.  

Instead, users of Cerrio log into their account using a web browser and jump right into their visual development and maintenance environment called the Cerrio HogMap.  Developers simply drag, drop and configure data adapters, data storage and routing nodes, and stream operators to build real-time systems.  Cerrio developers work with live data and live systems allowing them to develop and iterate quickly.  The attached appendices illustrate the power of our visual development environment.

Additionally, real-time software built on Cerrio runs in the cloud, is redundant and scales naturally as the userâs needs grow.  Trading systems built on Cerrio are handling 5 millions updates per second with latencies under half a millisecond.

Cerrio removes the frictions associated with building real-time software and Cerrio developers easily and affordably leverage the full advantages of the cloud and build the real-time systems their customers are demanding.

29975,JackTheDonkey.com,web,11/1/08,social-networking ,"JackTheDonkey.com is the community where your time online supports the charity of your choice. Or what some call, a socially conscious social network.

Jack donates more than half of all ad revenue generated by an individual's time online to their choice of more than 20 charities from across Canada and the US, and now the UK to the tune of 1.1 cents every impression (paid at par depending where the charity is registeredâ¦or at least that is the theoryâ¦the advertisers to date have been friends and family so I have been covering the 1.1 cents myself). The number of impressions and how you create them is up to you.  Simply sharing, viewing or commenting on pictures or âdeep thoughtsâ makes cents!

Jack also takes a ""softsell"" approach to keeping the charities top of mind among existing supporters, while trickling into the consciousness of potential supporters, as the charities' Twitter feeds have recently been incorporated into their supporters' personal profile pages...viewable to the community.

Yes, the name will always sound a little untraditional, but JackTheDonkey.com is working to connect with individuals who are traditionally unengaged from anything remotely related to volunteerism and fundraising.

There is another key component to the site that we are rolling out in the near future which will provide an additional stream of funds for the charities on jackthedonkey.com.

There are more than  20 charities from across Canada, the US and now the UK that you can choose to support with your time online including: 

- Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation 
- Best Friends Animal Society (featured on Dogtown) 
- The ALS Society of Canada 
- Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
- Canadian Tire JumpstartÂ® 
- Card Therapy 
- Children's Craniofacial Association 
- The Children's Wish Foundation of Canada 
- Eating Disorders of York Region 
- Lilah's Fund 
- The Malibu Foundation for Environmental Education 
- The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada 
- New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity 
- Ontario Special Olympics 
- Pencils For Kids 
- Plug In America (featured in Who Killed The Electric Car?) 
- Ronald McDonald House Charities of Canada 
- The Reena Foundation 
- The Scouts Canada Foundation 
- Sustainable Laos Education Initiatives Inc.

www.JackTheDonkey.com is free for the charities and members of the community, but not for the corporate sponsors/advertisers (who we are actively working to get onboard...to date they have been friends and family so I have not been charging them while I continue to pay the 1.1 cents per impression to the charities).

As of December 2008, Plura has approximately 50,000 nodes in its grid.  Due to patent-pending technology, the company can offer this compute power at a price that is approximately 10-12x cheaper than competing solutions, such as Amazon EC2 and traditional HPC providers.

Plura works with a variety of organizations, such as non-profits and websites, to connect thousands of computers to its grid.  Plura's technology allows visitors to a website to become part of the grid through use of lightweight Java applet.  This applet runs in a very secure framework thanks to the Java sandbox model.  The applet can be integrated with other Java or Flash applications, allowing for dynamic control.

Plura pays the website in exchange for the computer power provided by the website's visitors.  This compensation creates a new, incremental source of revenue that does not compete with ads.  The company already has several popular sites as affiliates, such as Desktop Tower Defense and several popular game portals.

As the internet continues to evolve, small and mid-sized publishers are often left to fend for themselves when it comes to monetizing all of their ad inventory. With so many companies touting different technologies and sales pitches for specific tiers of inventory, it can be overwhelming trying to decide who will provide the best overall results. One of the biggest challenges for publishers is finding partners that they can trust to help them achieve the best results. Either their partners fail to understand their business, do a poor job of monetizing their inventory, fail to provide adequate customer support, or simply dont pay a publisher the money they have earned. PubGears solves the problems mentioned above by combining extensive experience, superior customer service, key strategic partnerships, utilizing tools usually out of reach for small and mid-size publishers, and payment inside of net 30 to improve cash flor.  We pay publishers exactly what's stated in our reports and assume the risk of collecting payments from third parties.

This cash pay market trend is a result of the over 50 million Americans that are uninsured, shopping for affordable health care options.  Even patients that are insured end up paying thousands of dollars a year out-of-pocket, so Save On Medical allows them to view the average price for services in their area, allowing them to contact the medical facility that fits their needs and is in their price range.

The website allows patients to schedule appointments online and even receive further discounts if they pay online upfront, which cuts out the hassle of dealing with billing and collection companies, for both patients and providers.

We set up advanced data filters that allow us to weed out the irrelevant information and segment the rest. We recommend letting the new setup collect at least 1-2 weeks worth of data to provide a good benchmark for the initiatives to come.

During the initial benchmarking phase, Chicago Style SEO will do extensive research to find appropriate keywords for your website and business.

While the paid placement campaign runs, Chicago Style SEO will give your website a thorough review and report with recommended changes and improvements. During this period, we also take an in depth look at your main competition to determine strengths and weaknesses (to emulate and exploit, respectively). Finally, we will provide comprehensive link building assessment that becomes the road map for new initiatives.

Once the pay-per-click campaign has gathered enough data, we can make a strong determination of the keywords that we will focus on for organic search engine optimization. At this point, we fine tune your website with these keyword phrases in mind and begin the link building campaign.

It includes project, sales and document management, resource scheduling, CRM and accounting tools in a common powerful interface. 

Although there are various applications around that fulfil some of the areas mentioned here, the financial, managerial, and educational overhead of spreading your data across multiple services is high. Skylight brings it all together in one common interface.

Skylight provides a home for common business data that would otherwise often be put into excel sheets and forgotten about. This includes contacts, project data, invoices/quotes/POs, resource schedules, tasks and project documentation (via google docs). Objects can be related to each other in a variety of ways - e.g. tasks can relate to resources, projects or stages, and documents can be related to multiple objects via ""attachments"". It's easy to see a full history of projects and tasks for any given contact, for example. Through a highly flexible tagging system, businesses can devise their own strategy for categorising content, in a way specific to their industry.

Skylight lives entirely in the cloud, so data is accessible securely from anywhere in the world at any time.


Skylight is currently in public beta with 2500 registered businesses. We are close to launching the app officially in the next few months. 
 
Why Skylight?

We have run various successful businesses in the media sector and struggled to find a single product that fulfilled our growing data-management requirements, and had to rely on various tools for different sections of our workflows. This was financially expensive and had a huge overhead for every new team member to learn all the systems/applications involved to manage the business. There was a continual difficulty in synchronising these disparate services too.

Skylight solved this by providing a common powerful interface for critical business data, it's flexible enough to be used for any business sector and powerful enough to fulfil the requirements of any growing business.

Melon agrees with the US Energy Secretary Chu that ""Energy efficiency is not just the low hanging fruit, its the fruit that grows on the ground.""

We launched Melon to take advantage of two trends.

First the over 1M smart meters installed in commercial buildings that have easy to access data thanks to the Green Button standard.

The second is laws popping up across the United States that require over 60,000 buildings to publicly report their Energy Star Score.

Our initial product provides low cost, dead simple Energy Star benchmarks to commercial building owners allowing them to understand their energy use compared to their peers and in many cases comply with local disclosure laws.

We recently were one of the winners of the US Dept of Energy Apps for Energy Challenge, beating over 50 other apps for a $16,000 prize.  We also are currently regional semifinalists for the Cleantech Open accelerator.

Our three sales channels are direct to owners, through service providers, and as a tool for utilities to provide to their customers.

Craig's interests in energy efficiency started in 2006.  After living in China working as an investor and breathing dirty air for 2 years, he decided to focus his career on energy efficiency, renewable energy and making the planet a better place

Since then he received an MBA from Wharton, managed billions of dollars in stimulus funds for the US dept of Energy, and developed commercial building strategies for Johnson Controls, the worlds largest energy efficiency company.

The 15th and 16th Centuries marked the beginning of the Age of Exploration, a time of bold action, vast territorial expansion and profound intellectual discovery. Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594), a mathematician and cartographer, played a key role in these ventures. He was as important to navigation as Copernicus was to astronomy. He perfected a map projection that was the first to represent the spherical surface of the earth in two dimensions. The Mercator Projection effectively transformed navigation, making it possible for ships to deliver cargo safely to any port on the globe.

Inspired by the spirit of our namesake, Mercator MedSystems has developed a medical technology that enables the safe and accurate delivery of therapies anywhere in the body, ranging from drugs for diseased blood vessels, to stem cells that regenerate ailing tissues and organs. We believe this breakthrough will allow the expansion of medical therapy and stimulate profound intellectual exploration into new treatments for disease.

230996,Universal Display,other,,,"Universal Display Corporation is a world leader in the development of innovative OLED technology for use in flat panel displays, lighting and organic electronics. Since our founding in 1994, our mission has been to provide these innovations to OLED manufacturers for their use in commercializing new generations of OLED products. To do so, our business strategy consists of these key elements:

    Technology Licensing
    UniversalPHOLED® Materials Sales
    Technology Development and Technology Transfer Services

Universal Display has one of the largest patent portfolios in the OLED field with licensing rights to over 1000 issued and pending patents worldwide in a broad array of OLED technologies, materials and processes. This portfolio is the result of highly-productive collaborations between Universal Display and university partners at Princeton University, the University of the Southern California and the University of Michigan. Additionally, it contains OLED patents from Motorola Inc., for which we control sole sublicensing rights.

We have entered into more than 30 business agreements with leading manufacturers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Europe and the U.S. including with companies such as Chi Mei EL, DuPont Displays, Konica Minolta, LG Display, Samsung SMD, Seiko Epson, Sony, Tohoku Pioneer and Toyota Industries.

Universal Display is headquartered in Ewing, New Jersey in a 40,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility. Here, our highly-skilled team performs cutting-edge OLED technology development, provides technology transfer and assistance services to our partners, and develops and fabricates a variety of technology prototypes to support the customized needs of our partners.

Lighter, thinner, more energy-efficient, and more visually-appealing - these are some of the qualities that richly colorful OLEDs offer to flat panel displays and lighting. As a pioneer in the development of flexible OLED displays and white OLEDs for lighting, we find ourselves at the forefront of OLED applications previously unimagined. Thanks to innovations currently being readied for commercialization, Universal Display is leading the way in making vision a reality.",GBR,,New Jersey,unknown,,,0,0,,,0

From the experience, we witnessed an up-close view of the deep emotional struggles that a life changing realization of being diagnosed brings with it. As a result of witnessing this, we developed Balls of Steel whiskey drink coolers and a community to go along. In the BOS community, men and their families struggling with testicular cancer are provided with an outlet where they are able to seek emotional refuge and tell their story. ",,,,unknown,,,0,0,,,0

Web 2.0 tools are adequate for raising issues and addressing single-dimensional issues.  Their use in tackling more difficult problems is frustrates users with a absence of closure.

Facilitated, face-to-face dialogue methods may be the most powerful techniques ever developed for characterizing a problem space, but they are expensive, time intensive, require a trained facilitator, and fail to nimbly respond to changes in the situation.  For over 60 years, these shortfalls have prevented widespread adoption of dialogue techniques.

Poyzd adapts and extends the core functions of facilitated dialogue for the web.  The web application substitutes for the trained facilitator.  Users are guided through a six-step process that takes them from establishing a shared vision, identifying metrics and common goals, and planning and tracking actions.

Each step is equivalent to the level of an online game.  User/players are awarded points for ideas and collaborative behavior; they are dinged for negative behaviors.  Users are given scores for the expertise they apply to a single problem, and each receives a lifetime problem solver score.  Scores can translate to real-world benefits through enhanced reputations that lead to real-world, compensated assignments.

DaLockr is a cloud-based, digital asset management platform that empowers content creators to set their own terms for ownership, control, privacy, publishing, sharing and the tracking of user engagement across the Internet.

THE PROBLEM: The growth of smartphones, social media and
high-speed networks has accelerated the creation and sharing of massive amounts of media, including photos, videos, playlists and comments every moment, all over the world. Managing social media has become a time-consuming, out-of-control process. User-generated content (UGC) and premium content are stored in many places -- on smartphones, cameras, tablets, PCs/hard drives, cloud storage services and different social media sites and apps -- making it difficult to find, manage and access. Posting content on social media sites requires users to relinquish control over their digital assets. Users are subject to each social media sites specific terms of service, which poses growing concerns about privacy, ownership and data integrity. Social sites and apps provide limited data to users on the social flow and engagement of their content -- likes, shares, and comments within their walled gardens -- and as a result, estimating social status is mostly a guess, not a true reflection of
aggregated user data. Social media emerged in the Web 2.0 era and has not evolved to the meet the growing needs of
consumers who want more control over their digital content,
brands and engagement.

THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY: The social media market is
primed for disruption as content creators want more control of
their digital media assets, publishing and user analytics.
DaLockr stands ready with the development of the Open
Content Graph model and its proprietary digital asset content
management platform. DaLockr has the potential to de-wall the social media walled gardens and enable content creators to set their own terms of service for sharing their content across the Internet, transforming social media from a Web 2.0 landscape to an open content ecosystem architected specifically for the next phase of the Internet -- the converging IP media ecosystem.

DALOCKRs CONTENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
DaLockrs architecture uses open Web and open source technologies to achieve the highest levels of performance and scalability. The multi-tiered architecture consists of the metadata model, data layer, engine, open content graph API and applications. DaLockrs secret sauce is the contextual DaLockr Engine, which enables it to easily and efficiently scale. The DaLockr Engine simplifies the complexity of managing, sharing, and tracking online digital content. DaLockrs has an open content graph API, which provides real-time data about the digital assets to integrate with third

Custom developed versions of the proprietary software are offered to corporate customers and organizations, for their internal use or use on their own website, in both travel and logistics. For example, the Travel Helper developed for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the integration with Nokia's Green Explorer and the internal version for the Swiss government.
http://www.routerank.com/business/

Another version illustrating the software is also publicly available on routeRANK's website. For an example, click here to for the website of search results for the trip from Lausanne to Cambridge:
http://www.routerank.com/en/search/lausanne_switzerland/cambridge_united+kingdom/
http://www.routerank.com

Having won the Swiss National Venture Leaders and Venture Kick competitions, in September 2008 routeRANK was selected as one of the four finalists in the PICNIC Green Challenge, and in November, it was the laureate of the 2008 KPMG Tomorrow's Market Award. It has since been nominated as a Red Herring 100 Europe, for the Green IT Innovation Award and the TechCrunch Europas Awards 2009. More recently, It won bronze in the Best of Swiss Web Awards and was named a TR35 by MIT's Technology Review Magazine.

The WWF has approved routeRANK's CO2 methodology, and Dr Klaus Toepfer, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), endorses routeRANK as 'a system [that] will make informed travel choices possible which are not only cost- and time-efficient but also benefit the environment'.",,,,unknown,,,0,0,,,0

The internet is the biggest source of music ever. There are billions of songs available to stream for free. But the music landscape is fragmented, between the multitude of different platforms where people post music, and the places where people share and talk about music.

 - Digital photography and its adaptation to mobile devices have made taking photos limitless, multiplying the number of shots, resulting in the removal of sentimental value.

 - At a time when communication is becoming less and less tangible, vintage and old fashion items are regaining interest.

With those two ideas in mind, we decided to change the way we share photos and how we use postcards. _Momentic_ is the tool you need to transform your personal pictures into real postcards, sent in envelopes from your mobile.

In March 2009, they launched a Beta version and demoed it at FinovateStartup 2009. Expensify's mission? Help people create expense reports that don't suck! In May 2009, Expensify raised $1M, hired some additional engineers, and went to Istanbul for a month in order to write the award-winning Salesforce.com Expensify application. Later that year, they demoed an integration of Outright and Expensify at TechCrunch50 2009. In December of 2009, Expensify 1.0 launched to high acclaim. 

What is Expensify? Expensify imports expenses and receipts straight from your credit card or bank account, submits PDF expense reports by email, and reimburses reports up to $10,000 entirely online. With the 1.0 launch, Expensify bolstered its QuickBooks export features, helping bookkeepers, accountants, and finance departments nationwide to integrate their expense reports with ease. In September 2010, Expensify raised an additional $5.7M to keep fighting the war against sucky expense reports. A couple additional first-class engineers joined the Expensify team to clean up some rough edges, and went to the Philippines to focus on redesigning the previous Expensify UI. Increasing the number of mobile apps offered from 1 (the iPhone) to 4, including BlackBerry, Android, and Palm Pre, the Expensify team also added support for 159 international currencies, including automatic conversion to default currency. 

After returning from the Philippines, Expensify has settled into a space in San Francisco's Financial District, hustling to exterminate some high-level bugs discovered after the redesign, cementing the foundation laid abroad in preparation for huge updates to the mobile apps and receipt features, and focusing on the future, when Expensify hopes to add even more new engineers to help them flesh out this incredible product.

Chosen is a company based around two principles: commitment to our customers and cutting-edge technology. We aim to create a solution that not only works within your budget, but that follows new trends and technologies, offering the prefect balance of creativity and functionality.

You can spend a lot of money working with a large corporation employed by a generation that was raised on old standards, design, and development principles and âfeel comfortableâ because theyâve been in business longer, or they have a large office, or a lot of fake awardsâ¦.

You can spend a very small amount of money and get your website built by a company based out of the country or by your nephew whoâs in college and knows how to build you a myspace page. This may make you feel like youâre getting a âgreat dealâ because itâs so cheap, but you get what you pay forâ¦.

Our business is far from either of these principles. We were the guys making websites for our family and friends in college and we were also working for âthe manâ and big corporations, and we realized that neither were of the caliber that we wanted. So we went out to change the web. We are young, and we are bold, but weâre also very good. We could program in our sleep (not joking, we often dream in code.. itâs scary) and we donât produce work that we donât like. If you work with us, weâre not going to just be your designers or developers. Weâre going to be your friends that you can call night or day and ask for favors. Weâre the friend that will make suggestions and be honest and forward with you. Weâll be the friend that you can trust, chat with, and get advice from. So if youâre looking for just a plain website, call the other guys, we donât mind.. honestly. But if youâre looking for more, call us, and letâs change your business together!",USA,CO,Lafayette,Denver,,,0,0,7/1/08,7/1/08,1

238265,Graduate Writer,education,8/20/10,,"GraduateWriter.com was created to provide serious students  mostly those at the graduate and post-graduate levels  with an alternative to larger, less personalized, academic writing services. Instead of their theses and dissertations being just a number in the eyes of the term paper mills of the industry, students find themselves treated as individuals, with their own uniquely important aspects, goals, and procedures.

Each potential client is asked to submit the details of their project so they can be reviewed by either the owner of the company, or else another of the expert writers who works with Graduate Writer. Only a few extremely qualified professional academic writers work with this site; all of them are native speakers of English; and all of them have at least 15 years' worth of experience as professional academic writers. This site is nothing like the large conglomerates found elsewhere on the internet, with hundreds of writers from all over the world. No: it is more along the lines of having a personal writing service whose primary goal is the attainment of academic success for each individual client.

For the past several years, all of the writers at Graduate Writer have focused almost exclusively upon larger projects such as theses, dissertations, capstone projects, and action research projects. They are very happy to assist with lower-level research and term papers as well, but it is true that the focus is upon the upper-level student.

Regardless of the subject matter, Graduate Writer can assist graduate students with their critical projects. The writers there can create original material, revise a draft, conduct research, or perform some combination of all of the above.

Company History

SambaStream was founded in August 2008 by Alessandro Giannone, David Gildeh and Clarence Sittampalam, three technology consultants specialising in Information Management Systems. Sambastream was created with the aim to provide affordable and accessible enterprise level tools for information management.

Before creating Sambastream the founders worked alongside leading enterprise software vendors in information management. Their professional lives have been spent at the forefront of software within this field, delivering large IT projects for both corporate, government and non-profit organisations. They noted that application suites typically come at great cost and were limited to those organisations with large IT budgets. In addition increased adoption of consumer electronics and the web have raised the expectation from end users for more sophisticated online tools for completing work. These trends provide the platform for a new type of software business.

By adopting the âsoftware as a serviceâ delivery model, SambaStream aims to provide its customers and partners with a more affordable on-demand service compared to traditional software licenses and on-premise installations. SambaStream's goal is to become an innovative leader in the provision of online software.

We are eager to hear from potential partners and customers about working together. If you require further information on SambaStream or have something of interest to share, please contact us.

An EQAL media property is a multiplatform digital magazine that creates a seamless experience for fans across various devices and social networks. With more than 40 media properties, EQAL's award-winning Media Networks include Jennifer Lopez.com; Bethenny.com; Elizabeth Banks.com; ToriSpelling.com; Lauren Conrad.com; Alicia Silverstone's TheKindLife.com; Derek Hough.com; YouTube phenoms ElleandBlair.com and Michelle Phan.com; WalkWithWalgreens.com, KRAFT's Effie Award winning RealWomenofPhiladelphia.com and others. The growing EQAL network reaches more than 60 million trend-setting consumers and generates billions of content impressions every month. EQAL Media Studios produces the portfolio of content for the YouTube Original fashion & beauty channel u look haute. EQAL was founded by online programming pioneers Miles Beckett and Greg Goodfried who created many of the ""firsts"" in the development of the online video industry with lonelygirl15, KateModern and Harpers Globe.

EQAL's pop culture-obsessed teams of editors; writers, designers and social media experts create multiplatform media properties in partnership with familiar personalities and brands across numerous verticals. 

Umbrella is our proprietary social publishing platform that powers our network of highly interactive social websites and mobile apps. The core platform is an API that integrates dozens of third-party API's, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare, Instagram and more. Because Umbrella websites and applications are connected via API's to popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter, our media properties are ""service and device agnostic,"" making it easy for fans to interact with the property on their favorite social network using their preferred device. 

The Umbrella platform consists of a web-services application and RESTful API that provides a generic interface for dozens of third-party social API's. Applications built on top of the Umbrella API can seamlessly read-write data across multiple services with fewer API calls and lower overhead. The platform includes a content management system and a mobile publishing application, and provides a framework for future application development including mobile consumer apps, connected-television apps, and more. 

?Our innovative ""sponsored post"" ad unit is integrated into the feed of content on the homepage of our celebrity websites and syndicated to social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Because the ads are shareable, like-able, and incorporate discounts and giveaways, they drive high levels of engagement and ROI. Leveraging our branded content team, brand advertisers can directly work with our celebrity partners to create an on-site ""celebrity campaign"" or a micro-site ""branded community.""

EQAL's worked with the biggest brands on earth, including Kraft, Walgreens, Avon, Clorox and more, and set the bar for social media advertising with the 2011 Effie award-winning Real Women of Philadelphia campaign.

We feel there is still an absence for an application that would allow us to design and discuss our images more efficiently, so we created ViaPhoto. 

ViaPhoto is an online application that makes it easy for photographers to organize, design and discuss photos. To start, clients create color labels to organize the photos in the collection.  Photos can either be shared privately, shared with others or auto-design using our easy-to-use album designer. ViaPhoto also makes it easy to proof and discuss photos by allowing users to make comments directly on the image in real-time. It's like your clients are right there beside you.

ViaPhoto is great for all types of photography and photographers.  Whether you are a seasoned pro or just beginning, ViaPhoto has endless possibilities that will make your work more productive and efficient.

87732,IncentiVine,enterprise,5/2/11,Local business social marketing platform,"IncentiVine provides local business owners with a word of mouth marketing platform to identify, incentivize, track, and reward brand advocates and loyal customers via a simple three step process. IncentiVine gives local merchants an easy to use online version of what all offline local business marketing efforts are based upon: the exchange of special treatment for a customerâs promotional support.

A local bar owner may offer a familiar customer a few drinks on the house just as a restaurant owner may let their regulars skip the line. Or, a spa owner may perhaps give their loyal customers a free session on a slow night. While these forms of special treatment cost a local business owner hardly anything, these small gestures make a customer feel special and thus a sense of obligation
to help spread the word and rave to friends and family about how great a particular establishment is. However, this also happens to be the single most time consuming and exhausting part of running a local business. Additionally, the promotional strength of a local business is typically limited to the ownerâs personal network and the amount of personal face-time he dedicates to his
customers.

With IncentiVine, local business owners can drastically multiply the effectiveness of their marketing efforts by incentivizing brand advocates and loyal customers to quickly and effectively share their message to thousands of their friends and family via email, Facebook, Twitter, and other popular online social networks. Owners can also track which of their brand advocates are truly influential and which ones to not waste time and energy on.

Treebos presents a new way of organizing small farms and engaging with food that is just for the producer, healthy for the consumer, and sustainable for the planet. It uses a vertically integrated model and inclusive network to increase farmer productivity and income.

Treebos.com enables web-users to plant virtual trees online that represent actual fruit trees that Treebos plants in small farms in Brazil. Subscribers watch their trees grow online and Treebos also provides subscribers with their personal social and environmental impact metrics. They also purchase subscriptions that deliver the fruit sourced from these trees or local sustainable farms to their homes and offices. This creates a new source of web-aggregated capital that subsistence farmers use to rebuild their agri-businesses using organic methods and increase their income.

Treebos addresses massive inefficiencies in Brazilian agriculture and supply chains: up to 40% of produce gets lost on the way from the farm to table and the farmer gets only around 7% of the final market price. Brazil alone has over 3 million subsistence farms that lack access to productive investment and security of sale.

To date there are over 2000 recipes (and growing) on OSF, each with a picture, all created by the community.

Apart from the usual social networking features (add recipe, comments etc) the site has some unique technology and promotional points.  

1) Members can be promoted to ""PRO"" status if they gather enough votes.  PRO members are flagged with a little red mark, a sign that their recipes are of a high quality.  Recipes in the main listing can be filtered by whether they are by PRO members or not.

2) When adding a recipe members can ""AUTO TAG"" it - tags are created automatically based on the content.  This saves users time.

3) ""Spotlight"" recipes - recipes that gather enough votes are promoted to spotlight status and get posted in the header of the site (next to the logo) attracting more visits to that recipe.

OSF is a one-man project, by Tokyo-based Web Producer ""yongfook"" (Jon Anthony Yongfook Cockle).  http://www.yongfook.com

It is built in the php MVC framework Code Igniter and uses jquery for front-end scripting.

Yongfook is a serial web-app builder, responsible for the popular (but now deadpooled) 8apps.com, and also did the front end work for ZapZap.com (now deadpooled!) - both have been featured on techcrunch.

Websites increasingly use code snippets called tags to make their websites run--tags are used for integrating analytics, marketing conversion tracking (pixels), surveys, video, widgets, A/B testing, live chat, and more. 

As tag usage has increased, so has tagging pain. UberTags built a container tag solution that makes it dead-easy to manage website tagging. Site managers simply paste their UberTag across their site(s) and then deploy all other tagging right from a browser. So, for example, you can deploy conversion tags on your thank-you pages, live chat on your support site, A/B testing on your landing pages, and analytics and retargeting across every page of your site via a browser in just a few minutes. 

Key benefits: 
> Sites load faster! The core page loads then tags stream asynchronously.
> Launch a tag in minutes instead of waiting for IT.

Galectin Therapeutics uses naturally occurring carbohydrate polymers with galactose residues to create complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights.

We focus on diseases with serious, life threatening consequences to patients, and those where current treatment options are limited. Our strategy is to establish clinical development approaches that add value to the Company in the shortest time possible, and to seek partners as the program advances and requires much greater resources.

Galectin Therapeutics leverages extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost effective and efficient development. We are pursuing a clear development pathway to clinical enhancement and commercialization for our lead compounds in liver fibrosis and cancer immunotherapy.

People compete for bounties, whether it is giving feedback on a product or service, or performing a task.  BountyIt has a built in system for feedback where a poster puts up the bounty ahead of time and can disperse it according to who they feel gave the best response.  For example, if someone posts a bounty for $10 asking how they can better manipulate their product or service, and thirty people answer, but five people did a much better job, they could give all $10 to the top response, or $2 to each of the top five depending on what they feel is most deserved.  
Bountyit also has an easy to use freelance service section, where a poster puts up what they would like to be done or a service they can perform for an estimated cost.  People will then compete for the service bounties by describing why they would be fit for the job, as well as providing a profile with their resume, previous ratings, portfolio etc.  Once the cost is agreed upon, BountyItâs system ensures that no funds are released until both parties agree that the project has been completed,  which includes a built-in milestone management system for larger projects.  We then have the ability to monitor and act on any disputes that may arise in order to minimize risk for both parties.

In fact, Birlamedisoft started off as a 'all in one' medical software program before we took the modular route and made Birlamedisoft a versatile umbrella brand for the entire range of our retail medical software programs.

We realized at the time that though the healthcare industry had many specialized and dedicated programs, there were no integrated ones that were 'doctor friendly', affordable and useful to the 'Small Office Home Office' or SOHO user. There were some that printed Reports while some managed the Billing. None of them did everything and certainly none did or still does all that Birlamedisoft programs do.

We decided, then, to become 'doctor friendly' and give them the type of program that they really wanted but didn't know who to ask. We knew, because we have a doctor creating our programs. Only a doctor can know what another doctor wants. 

Why should you choose Birlamedisoft as your Healthcare Software Provider

1. An ISO: 9001-2008 Company, operational since 2001.
2. Personal attention of Managing Director & CEO in all the operations.
3. The Mind behind the developments is a Doctor, MS(OBST & Gynae) & Highly experienced Software Professionals. They know all the medical & software development terms and can drive the software in minute details as per the needs of the organization needs.

This technology empowers independent artists and music labels to build fan communities using social media and sell digital and physical merchandise, such as digital downloads, ringtones, CDs and promotional items, to them. 

Audiolifeâs technology platform is an engine driving the D2F business model popular among independent musicians and music labels, music marketing professionals, promoters and others in the music industry. The Audiolife e-commerce model encourages artists to control the design, distribution and marketing of their music while creating a direct relationship with their fans through unique digital and physical product offerings. It bypasses the traditional music industry model, capitalizing on Web innovations to put the power of promotion and profits back into the hands of artists. 

The goal of Audiolifeâs D2F technology is to give artists an opportunity to generate streamlined revenue without incurring thousands of dollars in up-front costs. Audiolife has designed an e-commerce platform that is user-friendly and relevant to the changing dynamics of consumer behavior. In addition, Audiolife provides resources to its members to support a virtual storefront with back-end manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The Audiolife technology is available directly to artists via www.audiolife.com or through channel distribution partners, including ReverbNation. 

How It Works
â¢	Artists log onto Audiolife.com to create a free membership profile â or use any of the portals powered by Audiolife technology, such as the Reverb Store from ReverbNation. 
â¢	Members can use Audiolifeâs extensive library of images and tools to design merchandise or upload their own designs to create products for virtual storefronts. Products sold through the virtual storefront can include merchandise such as CDs, T-shirts, digital downloads and ringtones.
â¢	Artists then post the Audiolife virtual storefront on any social networking profiles, band Web sites or blogs. They make money when fans purchase these products. Artists also can buy promo items in bulk through their Audiolife e-commerce platform to sell at live shows or on tour.

The core feature of the offering is a timeline that shows events in your life on a time scale. Each of these events, also known as blobs are composed of media ( photos, videos, text ) and relations ( people, place, interests, timelines, other things you care about ). Every relation in lifeblob is represented as a timeline - the interesting thing about these timelines is that they are connected with each other.

An example to show how this works - If you come back from a trip with your friends, you can make a post on your timeline and add your friends as participants. This immediately causes the post to show up on your timeline and also the timelines of your friends. Add to it that you were in Las Vegas and the post also starts showing up on the Las Vegas timeline.

This builds an interesting social structure where as your friends and family add posts to their timelines, those relevant to you become a part of your timeline automatically. It also turns on interesting discovery mechanisms where if you are planning to visit a place, you can meet people who have been there or live there on the place timeline and connect with them.

Timelines can be used to map your personal life, showcase achievements of your company, keep a runbook of events of your community and educational purposes too.

Founded by James Miao, Recurious wants to create better educational games for children. Miao believes that there is a gap in quality game design for kids. As Miao explains, most kids games dress up education into gaming, which he compares to covering broccoli with chocolate.

He thinks that having a more thoughtful approach to design of kids games is essential for self-motivated learning because it immediately engages kids and then gives them just enough of an information gap where the actual curiosity element kicks in. And its this curiosity that helps kids actually learn while playing a hame.

The startups first title Dinorama, which is aimed at kids ages 7 through 12, is based around encouraging children to build a dinosaur theme park. The actual gaming and creative element centralizes around how to make the park successful from a financial standpoint.

In Dinorama, kids learn about earning, spending, and saving money by building amusements for their visitors, caring for their dinosaurs, and weathering events like rainstorms that increase maintenance costs and lower ticket sales.",,,,unknown,4/17/13,4/17/13,1,1500000,1/1/13,1/1/13,1

Everyone should be able to contribute - no matter the size of the donation - and the best way to reach a broad donor base is to use social networks that already exist. When friends ask friends for support, a positive response is 10 times more likely, and the resulting gift is 52% higher.  Most organizations have understood this dynamic for some time but were limited in their ability to organize and manage volunteer fundraising at scale.

We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer. If you have a data set or API you would like to access with natural language, let us know.
Stay tuned as we expand SkyPhrase to more areas, make it more powerful and enable third parties to use our technology for their own data and applications.",,,,unknown,1/1/12,3/1/13,2,250000,10/2/13,10/2/13,1

78308,roundCorner,enterprise,9/1/09,Advance CRM for nonprofits & higher edu ,"roundCorner is Salesforce.com Foundationâs premier solution partner offering CRM solutions specifically designed for nonprofits and higher education institutions.

In 2003, the founders of roundCorner and a few other partners who were working on global, Siebel implementations in financial services developed a collective philosophy around a simple concept. That concept was that there had to be a better, faster, less-complicated way to deliver on the promise of CRM. Together, this group founded OKERE, INC, one of the most successful enterprise salesforce.com consulting partners in history. OKERE was successful because of this philosophy, the quality of the team and OKEREâs focus on a specific vertical industry that allowed the team to accelerate time to value for customers through shared best practices.

After evolving OKERE to be the leading global salesforce.com consulting partner with over 100 consultants, offices in New York, London, Sydney and Manila, and over 75 happy salesforce.com customers representing over 70,000 enterprise salesforce.com users, OKERE was sold to Fujitsu in 2007.

Shortly thereafter, roundCornerâs founders began searching for new vertical markets that would benefit from the value proposition of cloud computing, be rich with innovative talent yet hamstrung by the current economic conditions and market forces. Equally important, they felt strongly that their next venture should focus on making a significant, positive social impact and that the Salesforce.com Foundation was the best vehicle for this social change.

After collaborating with the President and CIO of Villanova University, the founders made a conscious, informed decision to launch roundCorner and become the Salesforce.com Foundationâs premier solution partner. Two years later, roundCorner and the Salesforce.com Foundation are revolutionizing the way that colleges, universities and nonprofit organizations reallocate their assets to achieve their missions.

Zyncro is an Enterprise Social Network, a private work environment for sharing information confidentially and securely, containing a social microblogging system, a document repository, a task manager, and a professional contact agenda. 

Zyncro integrates with the leading business management tools:
  *SharePoint
  *ERPs, such as SAP
  *BI systems (Pentaho, Google Analytics) and CRMs
  *Project management tools, like Doolphy
  *Google Apps: Gmail, Calendar and Drive
  *Social Networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, RSS and YouTube
  *Other corporate web applications: Evernote, SurveyMonkey
  *With any web content generator...

Zyncro uses social technology to enable organizations to:

  *optimize and reduce email use
  *improve internal knowledge retainment and management
  *make teamwork more efficient
  *motivate and involve employees in the corporate mission
  *provide access to corporate information and documents.

As well as being an enterprise social network, Zyncro can act as a Private Social Network, a space for collaboration and communication, perfect for any organization looking to build private social relationship with its customers, suppliers or partners... where contents and information generated do not belong to third parties (unlike Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) but to the users.

Zyncro also has a multi-organization structure, making it a ideal solution not only for single enterprises, but for groups and business communities looking for a common space to share information, news, files, contacts and applications.

The original Zyncro idea back in 2008 in the Grupo Inspirit technology laboratory consisted in creating a files synchronizer that would allow and individual to access all of their professional and personal documents ""in the cloud"".  Nonetheless, upon seeing the potential that this tool could have within a company, a more corporate approach was given to it each time.  At the same time, the ""surname"" social and the 2.0 style was inundating the Internet and it was then that the decision was taken to add collaborative and communicative functionalities to it that later converted it to what it is today: an intranet 2.0 or company social network.  This part of Zyncros trajectory is what Didac Lee, founder of Grupo Inspirit, considers the a ""Journey accross the desert"", which all startups must endure.  Thanks to the appointment of Luis Font as Zyncro CEO in November 2010, the business strategy and product definition became polished and sales and marketing departments were consolidated until we became what we are today.  And still on the uprise! ",ESP,,Barcelona,Barcelona,4/5/11,2/3/12,2,3805520,10/1/10,10/1/10,1

The rise of cloud storage and SaaS are highlighting limitations of conventional search and collaboration tools. Search returns many results that still need to be reviewed manually, and content management systems are often incompatible with the cloud storage paradigm.

Cloudfinds SaaS-based technology provides a much more effective solution to the problem of linking business processes with the right information from potentially millions of files, dramatically streamlining many day-to-day business processes. 

For enterprise users and teams, Cloudfind incorporates a fundamentally new way to manage information. Cloudfind automatically tags information from cloud files in a more intelligent way than keyword search and without relying on user-specified tags. 

Cloudfind is integrated with Salesforce.com, Google Drive, Box and DropBox, giving Sales users seamless access to cloud-based storage with the potential for dramatic productivity improvements.  Cloudfind works both directly with customers as well as with Salesforce.com implementation partners who incorporate its technology within larger solutions.

The server monitoring and alert solution is a powerful cloud service that was built to empower the IT professional to be the first to know when a job, process or transaction fails. 

It was made to be flexible to works with any existing monitoring solution and system platform (Windows, Mac, Mobile, Linux, Unix, embedded devices, etc.), and allows for implementation without the need of a programmer or developer via a simple copy-and-paste code.

Gartner.com, the world's leading information technology research and advisory company, reported that IT related downtime and outages per year cost companies on average $42,000 per hour. The Deadman Heartbeat solution helps IT professionals reduce and mitigate this downtime cost by being the first to know when downtime or an outage occurs, even before the Help desk, and the end-user impact.

How was the solution born?

The solution was built after witnessing repeated business downtime resulting from critical system process and transactions that didn't start, stop or simply failed. 

These failed processes and transactions were left unattended, and either could not be addressed by existing monitoring solutions or costly development time to implement a solution. And when they failed, the IT administrator was the last to know.

Deadman Heartbeat was built to give IT administrators control and peace of mind when something goes wrong, making them the first to know when ANY critical job or process fails. It also empowers the CIO and CTO to reduce the costs (operational and resource) associated to downtime.

How is it going? Even before its official launch Deadman Heartbeat had half a dozen multi-million dollar organizations on board with the solution; Canaccord Financial, BHP Billiton, Avcorp, Neptune Terminals, JYSK, Westshore Terminals, Kinder Morgan, Teck Resources and more, and strong interest from IT managed service providers (MPS).",CAN,,,Canada - Other,,,0,0,3/10/12,3/10/12,1

Specialties
J2EE, Groovy & Grails, Semantic Technologies, NLP, Android,  iPhone development, Big data

What we do:

Portals and sites
The portals developed by Paradigma range from websites or sites developed by two people for two or three months to major portals developed by teams of 20 people for over a year. However, all of them have a common characteristic; they are conceptualized and carried out to fit the individual needs and requirements of the client. See more


Web Applications
Each Web application developed by Paradigma is the subject of an initial study, which allow us to select the technology development framework both for back end and front end, as well as to choose from pure rich web interfaces in Ajax to interfaces which are rich in some cases, with Flex or other technologies, or in special cases slightly heavier. See more


Semantic Technology

Mobility

They enable students to improve comprehension and retention, professors to improve the effectiveness of class and office hours, and universities to boost facility and technology usage. 

However, most solutions for getting lecture content online are prohibitively expensive, difficult to use, and lack the operational simplicity required for university-wide acceptance. 

Anystream's Apreso Classroom is an affordable automated lecture capture and Web publishing system that produces online versions of the classroom experience for on-demand student review. 

Apreso Classroom can be scheduled to start and stop automatically, removing the need for professors to learn to operate the system or change the way they teach. It automatically captures and synchronizes the professor's voice with visual aids being projected in the classroom, and posts an interactive, indexed Web-based version of the lecture to university websites or course management system. 

Designed specifically for higher education, Apreso Classroom's enterprise architecture integrates with campus-wide information systems. Permanently installed in the classroom, and operating without attendants, Apreso Classroom is the first lecture capture system affordable and practical enough to be deployed campus-wide.

434,Snocap,games_video,,B2B Digital Music Distributor,"SNOCAP was a digital rights and content management startup founded in 2002 by [Shawn Fanning](http://crunchbase.com/person/shawn-fanning)(creator of the original Napster file-sharing service), [Jordan Mendelson](http://crunchbase.com/person/jordan-mendelson), and Silicon Valley investor [Ron Conway](http://crunchbase.com/person/ron-conway). 

Fanning, Mendelson and Conway founded SNOCAP in the days immediately following Napster's demise. Many of the company's employees, including its COO, [Ali Aydar](http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar), were veterans of the original Napster team.

SNOCAP's initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAP's digital registry. 

SNOCAP's ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of ""legal P2P"" services that used SNOCAP's technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels & artists didn't want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAP's technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched.

In late 2006, SNOCAP and [MySpace](http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace) announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAPâs MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpaceâs efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its [MySpace Music](http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music) venture. 

In March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site [imeem](http://crunchbase.com/company/imeem) to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAPâs content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007.

In April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAP's then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeemâs COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007.

imeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeemâs ad-supported streaming music service.

SNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures. In total, the company raised over $25 million in funding from WaldenVC, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Court Square Ventures.",USA,CA,San Francisco,SF Bay,1/1/02,3/1/06,3,25000000,1/1/07,11/12/09,3

Users are urged to ask questions and answer other users' questions, rate their doctors, participate in online discussions and otherwise contribute content.

Every user has a profile page where they can link up to other users, set personal goals and aggregate content they've contributed to the site.

Attributor offers products that enable publishers to identify and verify copy infringement, enforce authorized use, analyze market demand and monetize digital content.

Attributor's system crawls tens to hundreds of millions of pages on the Internet daily and verifies whether it is authorized reuse. When Attributor finds a use that is not permitted, the hosting site is alerted and receives a range of options depending on the publisher and author, including a request to swap for authorized content, a licensing request, or a DMCA takedown notice. 

Attributor can digitally fingerprint each piece of content to uniquely identify the content based on its essential features. Each content owner can define permitted use of their original content, such as how much can be copied, what kind of attribution is required and whether and on what terms commercial use is permitted.  

Attributor's products and services are highly scalable and are used by all types of publishers- from the largest in the world to individual authors across book publishing, news and magazine publishers and financial institutions.Operating 24x7 across geographies, Attributor's solutions address all of the components of the digital content ecosystem including supply, distribution and demand.

Research and Activity:  

In April 2009, Attributor and more than 1,000 publishing companies founded the Fair Syndication Consortium, the goal of which is to establish a new online content syndication model. 

In December 2009, Attributor and the Fair Syndication Consortium released research data on the proliferation of U.S. newspaper content, which found that over a 30-day period more than 75,000 unlicensed sites reused U.S. newspaper content online. According to the study, on these sites, 112,000 near-exact copies of unlicensed articles were detected. 

Attributor's FairShare Guardian service monitored 913 books in 14 subjects in the final quarter of 2009 and estimated that more than 9 million copies of books were illegally downloaded from the 25 sites it tracked. 

In April 2010, Attributor reported on online magazine infringement. The researched looked at a segment of the magazine industry: 133 English language magazine titles, and the infringement that occurs on just 20 of the more than 2,000 domains that illegally host full-issue downloads of these magazines. Among the results, Attributor found 3,996 instances of downloadable, full issues of these 133 magazines on these 20 sites, and 84 of the 133 (63%) magazines had infringements. 

Following the magazine report, Attributor produced an Ad Server Report that analyzed those that monetize content across 270 million domains, which is nearly 75% more domains and pages covered than in previous studies.

211499,Tickdata,software,1/1/84,,"In 1984, Tick Data was founded by a futures broker and a programmer as the first company in the world to offer historical tick-by-tick prices on the futures and index markets. Despite severe limitations in computer hardware technology, they developed a collection and compression system capable of capturing and storing every tick in the major US futures markets. The database extends back as far as 1974, making it the largest of its kind.

In June 1999, Thomas Neal Falkenberry, a Chartered Financial Analyst and Tick Data client, bought the company. By purchasing Tick Data, he had a data platform on which to launch his new asset management firm and hedge fund. Furthermore, he saw the potential in furnishing other institutional clients with data that meets their stringent requirements.

Neal and his partner, Scott Mayster, sold Tick Data to Penson Worldwide, Inc. in January 2005. Penson made Tick Data a division of their technology subsidiary, Nexa Technologies, Inc., a provider of online and direct access trading platforms and electronic order routing solutions. Neal and Scott continue to manage Tick Data with a team of sales, support, and development experts who specialize in market data.

Today Tick Datas product line includes even more equity, options, futures, cash index, and market indicator data. Our customer base includes the largest financial institutions, universities, and more than 10,000 individual traders and system developers.

In contrast, many well known examples of tag clouds, such as those seen on del.ico.us or flickr, are created by analyzing tags that humans entered. One major advantage of our approach is that tag clouds can be automatically generated from data that has not been tagged by people, such as data that changes too frequently for a person to tag. RSS data sources are now ubiquitous, and it is possible to turn nearly any data set into RSS, which makes it an extremely flexible input data source for MakeCloud.",,,,unknown,,,0,0,,,0

Their products allow website publishers to maximize the value of their customer visits using real-time behavioral targeting techniques in order to increase conversion rates and generate greater amounts of revenue.

EchoCurrent's first product was released on February 10, 2009 and is called the Affiliate Product Optimizer.

By truly listening to website visitorsâ words and actions, publishers can increase their revenues by optimizing their advertising content in real-time.  The EchoCurrent Affiliate Product Optimizer (or APO) is a widget used by website publishers to display a list of individually relevant and targeted product offers to their visitors. Any commission generated by the products in the APO zone goes directly to the site publisher through their own affiliate network relationship.  EchoCurrent provides tools and reports to monitor the effectiveness of the product offers.

To a visitor, an Affiliate Product Optimizer zone appears similar to a Google AdSense advertising box.  EchoCurrent supplies different sized zones as well as configurable styles to match our customersâ websites.  But unlike Google or Yahoo ads, the content is not based on the context of the page where it sits.  Rather, it is based on the current and recent activity of the visitorâ¦their âEchoâ.  Each web page will display product offers that are uniquely relevant to each individual visitor. 

The Affiliate Product Optimizer runs on top of the EchoCurrent Customer Intent Engine platform and more products are expected to be released on this platform in the near future.

In 2004, the eSwarm co-founders moved to Palo Alto, CA and started researching the fundamentals behind swarm theories in nature, and why swarms are so powerful.  One key fundamental is that solutions are distributed to swarms automatically and without centralized control, simply in how swarmers interact.  Whether it is fish swarming to avoid a predator, or when birds or ants swarm to feed or protect themselves, in nature there is always âstrength in numbersâ.  They realized that people, too, are swarming in many aspects of our lives so we decided to build a website that would harness the human potential of swarming.  The co-founders of eSwarm realized there was no technology on the Internet that could tap into the potential of swarm theory so that people could benefit from âswarmingâ.

The bullion is kept in approved vaults within the London Good Delivery system.  Good delivery bullion bars are produced by London Bullion Market Association [LBMA] approved refiners, have a known history and can be easily re-sold.  Most of the world's professional gold dealing happens within the LBMA good delivery rules.  BullionVault is a full member of the LBMA.

Unlike most gold investment products, BullionVault's clients own their gold directly as property in their own name within the jurisdiction the gold is stored.  Clients can chose to store their gold in Zurich, London, New York or Singapore.

An internal market allows clients can trade their holdings with each other in units as small as a single gram.  Clients can choose to place large orders [800oz] through the London professional markets.  BullionVault itself also runs trading bots to ensure liquidity, quoting two-way prices on its exchange 24/7.

In June 2010, the gold industry's key market-development body the World Gold Council joined with the internet and technology fund Augmentum Capital, which is backed by the London-listed Rothschild Investment Trust, in making an $18.8 million (GB £12.5m) investment in the business.  This makes BullionVault rare as a disruptive start-up that has been willingly embraced by an established industry.

Their exchange's technology stack runs almost entirely on open-source components.  CTO Kris Jenkins says, ""I couldn't imagine trying to build a company like BullionVault using proprietary software. I've seen startups die while they were still negotiating support contracts. Often when they could have picked an open solution so reliable it would never need support.""
